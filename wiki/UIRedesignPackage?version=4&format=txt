= Redesign Notes - Package page =

 * '''Ratings''' is rating really much use? It's hard to know what is being rated - quality, openness, interestingness, format. Suggest removing and focus on comments / discussion.
 * '''Comments''' - Suggest move to a separate tab and rename discussion as per Wikipedia. 
 * '''Comments''' - Add hint to new page suggesting what sort of comments/questions people should make
 * '''Getting the data''' - Can we make the download (Resources) section clearer or more prominant? This seems to be the primary purpose of this page for a casual user. 
 * '''Getting the data''' - 'resources' is unclear term, just call it 'downloads?'
 * '''Groups''' - Confusing having groups and tags on this page, suggest remove groups for now focus on tags as primary method for organising / grouping.
 * '''Tags''' - Should be able to add a tag directly via ajax (as per flickr)
 * '''Title''' - Name of package gets lot in the buttons (edit etc) and the package slug id
 * '''Buttons''' - move to top right
 * '''API / package slug''' - Create new API section the explains the slug id and how to access via datapkg etc
 * '''Completeness''' - If a package is missing a description / licence / download then display a prominent message in the header asking passing users to add the missing info
