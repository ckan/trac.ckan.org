Current Situation
-----------------

A resource belongs to a single package. A resource can only hold very limited pieces of information i.e a url, hash, a description and its format/type.  It also has state i.e whether it is active and not active.  They are versioned but not dated.

The user is given an option to reorder the resources against a package, this order has no relevance apart from how the information is displayed.


Use Cases
---------

 * Data should be able to be grouped by various different factors (type, date).

 * There needs to be a mechanism to timeline information the user puts in, so that search results only display the latest package. This needs to be done in a way that the older data is still easily accessible. This should be done with the minimum of user effort.

 * The ordering of the data should be presented without the need for user input.

 * There needs to more information stored against the data, beyond just its format and a description.

 * Users should be able to refashion the data and post a whole new set of this refashioned data.

 * Groups of data should be able to be synced across packages/instances.

 * When new versions of the data arrive it should be easy to copy an old one and change versions as required.

 * A user may want to upload a resource separately from the package and decide later on where its the best place for it is.
