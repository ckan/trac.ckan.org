Discussion of resources referred to in package meta data (currently Download URL)

On CKAN a Package just has metadata and doesn't store the resource (payload) (CKAN is just a registry). The CKAN metadata has a pointer, the download URL to find the associated resources.

Two sorts of resource links:

 1. Manifest
A set of filenames with accompanying description.[[br]]
e.g. [('!UkBirths1998.xls', '1998 data'), ('!UkBirths1999.xls', '1999 data')]

 2. Distributions
Each distribution is a serialisation / representation of the full Package - metadata + payload. (Or sometimes just the payload).[[br]]
e.g. mysite.com/births.xls.zip which contains the two excel files[[br]]
But it also includes cases where we have:
 *   mysite.com/births.csv.zip
 *   mysite.com/births/api (restful api to the same data)
 *   mysite.com/births.html (WUI to the same data)

Different representations of the same material - how do we deal with this? Options:
 1. each distribution has its own CKAN package.
 1. a CKAN package can refer to multiple distributions.
