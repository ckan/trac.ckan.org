= Design notes - search results page =

 * '''Tags''' - Move related tags to the sidebar confuses the purpose of the page having them as part of the results
 * '''Pagination''' - Remove the top pagination control. Standard behaviour is scroll down -> next scroll down ->next
 * '''Results''' - Display tags for each package inline to help use choose which once to click through
 * '''Search box''' - make each example in the "E.g. 'geo', 'shakespeare', 'science'" links
 * '''Resources icons''' - Not very useful as a link. Better to display inline the number of resources available
 * '''Filters''' - 'downloadable' isn't a term used elsewhere. Change to 'Packages with downloads or other resources'
 * '''Filters''' - explain 'open license' better
 * '''Results''' make use of a:visited to help browsing
 * '''No results''' - better call to action to add a package e.g. 'Do you know of a dataset relating to $search_term? help improve CKAN by adding it'
 * '''No results''' -  'No results' and '0 packages found' are displaid, choose one.
