= Redesign Notes - Package page =

 * '''Ratings''' is rating really much use? It's hard to know what is being rated - quality, openness, interestingness, format. Suggest removing and focus on comments / discussion.
 * '''Comments''' - Suggest move to a separate tab and rename 'Questions and Comments'
 * '''Comments''' - Display number of comments on button to draw user in
 * '''Comments''' - Add hint to new page suggesting what sort of comments/questions people should make
 * '''Getting the data''' - Can we make the download (Resources) section clearer or more prominant? This seems to be the primary purpose of this page for a casual user. 
 * '''Getting the data''' - 'resources' is unclear term, just call it 'Downloads & Resources?'
 * '''Getting the data''' - Add a hint explaining what they are.
 * '''Groups''' - Suggest renaming collections so users get the message they are curated
 * '''Tags''' - Should be able to add a tag directly via ajax (as per flickr)
 * '''Title''' - Name of package gets lot in the buttons (edit etc) and the package slug id
 * '''Buttons''' - move to top right
 * '''API / package slug''' - Create new API section the explains the slug id and how to access via datapkg etc
 * '''Completeness''' - If a package is missing a description / licence / download then display a prominent message in the header asking passing users to add the missing info
 * '''Meta data''' - rename 'About this package' and collect all such data into a single table
 * '''New users''' - add a welcome / intro message if users are new to ckan (cookie)
