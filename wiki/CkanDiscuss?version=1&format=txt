ckan-discuss is the email list for CKAN developers, administrators, partners and other parties interested. We aim to always use it to: 
 * discuss new features and issues
 * announce new features and bugfixes
 * answer queries

We like answering queries on the list, since many people are often wondering the same thing and so that the archives are a good store of answers for newbies.
