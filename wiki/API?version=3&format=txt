= The CKAN API =

CKAN has a fully-featured Application Programming Interface (API).

The API takes the form of a RESTful (Representational State Transfer) style API for accessing CKAN database objects and a Search API.

For full details of accessing the API, see the CKAN developer documentation at http://packages.python.org/ckan/api.html

== API Clients ==

=== PHP client ===
Ckan_client-PHP is an almost full and (I hope) easy-to-use interface to the CKAN APIs.

This example uses CKAN's search API and lists and reads Packages/Groups with the REST API.

=== Perl client example ===
This example accesses the CKAN REST API to get a list of the packages, count the uses of an 'extra' field and then plots it with the Google chart API.  Luke broke the CKAN bits out into a CKAN specific client library - Net::CKAN.  Luke is open to improving this library and eventually releasing it to CPAN.
