= About Releases =

The OKF aims to make releases CKAN regularly - minor points every two months. Find releases at: [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/ckan PyPI]. See the changes at on the [http://knowledgeforge.net/ckan/doc/ckan/CHANGELOG.html Changelog].

= Approaching release - alpha release =

 1. Change the version number to the next version alpha in ckan/__init__.py e.g. 1.2a
 1. Commit and push this change.
 1. Bring metastable branch in line with default: 
{{{
$ hg up -C metastable
$ hg merge -r default
$ nosetests ckan/tests
$ hg ci -m '[merge] from release 1.1a.'
$ hg push
}}}
