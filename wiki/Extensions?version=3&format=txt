= CKAN Extensions =

The CKAN codebase is open source so that different organisations can customise it for their own needs. As CKAN has grown in popularity it has become
especially important to organise the code in a way that can accommodate the customisations which different organisations require without those changes
interfering with customizations required by other organisations.

To meet this need we have introduced the concepts of CKAN extensions, plugin interfaces and workers. These work together to provide a simple mechanism to
extend core CKAN functionality. '''Full documentation of these features for developers can be found here: http://packages.python.org/ckan/plugins.html'''

If you create a new extension, please document it here. Implementations of plugin interfaces should be documented separately on the [wiki:Plugins Plugins] page.
