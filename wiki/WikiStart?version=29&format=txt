= What It Is =

CKAN is a '''registry or catalogue system for datasets or other "knowledge" resources'''. CKAN aims to make it '''easy to find, share and reuse open content and data''', especially in ways that are '''machine automatable'''.

Those familiar with software services like freshmeat, CPAN, or apt can think of CKAN as providing an analogous service for content and data.

The CKAN software is used to run the CKAN service: http://www.ckan.net/ and is also running the catalogue behind http://data.gov.uk/. CKAN is an [http://www.okfn.org/ Open Knowledge Foundation] project.

= Code and Docs =

CKAN code is in a mercurial repository here: http://knowledgeforge.net/ckan/hg

This Trac service is being used to track CKAN project developments. The full list of services associated with this project are listed here: http://knowledgeforge.net/project/ckan/services/

= Features =

Major features:

  * Free/Open-Source software, written in Python
  * Domain Model: Data and content "packages" with a standard set of core metadata and support for adding unlimited ''arbitrary'' additional metadata

    * Tagging of packages
    * Groups for controlled categorization of packages
    * Ratings
    * Unlimited associated package resources ('download urls') with additional metadata (format, description etc) 
  * Web user interface (WUI)
    * Package adding, editing, listing etc
