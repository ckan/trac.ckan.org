h.url() and h.url_for() amended to use the new url scheme
h.url_for_static() added for none language based urls (css, js)

Base templates updated.

IMPORTANT: pylons.url() removed from ckan.lib.base.render() as this allowed the language functionality to be ignored. Broken templates should use h.url() instead of url().

Yet looking at the dump from 17/11/10 when this ticket was created, the resource didn't have a URI, which by the current model is a requirement, so it suggests the data was fine underneath, but it had problems displaying this field, and is now fixed.

I've got not idea what I meant by "An issue for CKAN too."  I may have intended to log this againt ckanclient. Anyway, it seems to be just a CKAN thing. :-)

I think I would like to do this:

    $data = c.package_register_post({'name': 'example'})
    $data['title'] = 'Example'
    c.package_entity_put($data['id'], $data)

and this:

    $data = c.package_entity_get('example')
    $data['title'] = 'Example'
    c.package_entity_put($data['id'], $data)

I don't think either work. We could write a test for each.

I think this does work:

    $data = c.package_entity_get('example')
    $data = c.package_entity_put($data['id'], $data)
    $data['title'] = 'Old Example'
    c.package_entity_put($data['id'], $data)

Which is inconsistent. The reason is that the data returned by the update operation ("entity put") isn't given the same treatment as the read and create operations, which adds various read-only values.

That's as far as I got. I inferred that one or several of the read-only values, when present in the update request data, cause the update to fail. I'm not sure how it fails. Rather than cutting down the response data, we could make the update call more robust. One fix would pick out from the request package data only the attributes that are permitted. A alternative fix would make what ever is choking on the extra values ignore them. I mean, ids are read-only, but we wouldn't want to reject an update because it has an id in the data. We do need to be careful about loading up the package entity data, but the 'id' is read-only and we aren't going to quible about that being present in the data of an update request (even if it doesn't match the referenced entity).

I would rather not support "replace the entire package" with especial functionality and documentation. I think the model create/update/delete, where update is "set attributes" is sufficient, simple, and fairly optimal. To obliterate all registerd values without deleting, I would get the package entity data, loop over the keys and set the values to '', [] or {} depending on the type, and then PUT the entity. We could write a test for that.

Some general conclusions relevant to both:

 * General feeling is not to change to changeset model
  * I'm personally +0 on changeset model
  * I would note main benefit is simplicity and orthogonality of changesets to core system. I also think cost of change is small.
  * That said we can simplify current model as well.
 * There seems some misunderstanding: change to have logic layer has almost nothing to do with being able to remove main stateful stuff in vdm. To be able to remove most of stateful stuff in vdm requires us to make some other changes (re foreign keys from revision objects to continuity)
 * There are other simplifications we should make to vdm before embarking on this (e.g. move to SessionExtension from MapperExtension). This is easy as that work has been done in changeset branch and can be backported.

What I don't see in this CEP as yet is any discussion of the complexities around pending stuff (e.g. do we allow multiple pending, do new edits get shown current or latest pending). I'll try and comment more on this but a lot of this was in original vdm discussion last summer.

 * auto-complete on tags - DONE
 * department drop down options list interact with user permission - Evan building the API we need for this now.
 * licenses -&gt; drop down is fine, let's just OGL as default

So just default licence and replacing department with provider and via to be implemented on this ticket.

Evan will provide:

organisation.one() to look up one organsisation by ID

organisation.many() to look up a list of organsisation by ID all at once

organisation.match() to match a string and return a organsisation ID

organisation.department() to take a organsisation ID and return the organsisation ID of the department it represents.

                          <td class="newvalue">Just to say, in cases where something needs to be delivered by somebody else, it can be useful to create a separate task ticket (with undefined remaining time) to indicate what deliverable is being waited on, and in the sprint backlog to drag it above the ticket(s) that depend on the deliverable. That means we don't feel a need to factor unknowable waiting time into our own tasks. It also means impediments are more obviously displayed, so you don't lose track when waiting for a number of things. The two different objectives also well separated so there is no question that somebody is stuck and passing time on a task. I've done this a few times recently and it does help to keep things simple. :-)

                          <td class="newvalue">Kindly, I agree - it would be much preferable to have independent storage for plugins and this would be easy to do if we were using another type of storage already. As it stands, however, our storage mechanism is SQL. I think we should use it for what it is as much as possible and do the weird, vertical stuff (k,v tables, swapping to redis) only if we really need it. For everything else: lets use SQL as it was intended. 

Examples: 

 * We want to develop an apps catalogue as a CKAN plugin. While we could certainly put this in Redis, there is no reason why we can't have the following table: application (id, name, title, description, author, project_url, site_url, code_url, image).
 * A watchlist plugin could essentially work on UUIDs alone. What you'd end up with is something like this: watch (id, user, scope_id). 

Re migrations you're right, but my first intention would be to handle that seperatly for each plugin (i.e. they need to have their own migration repositories that they keep track of, e.g. via an apps_migrate_version table)
