Furthermore, key dev info like how to setup and do extensions *is* already in the main docs (see http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/writing-extensions.html) and has been for 6m+. I've created #2226 for more work on docs and you may wish to comment there.

I'd suggest we add a generic "failed to login, invalid fields" in the error_summary block. Then more specific "this field is required" when a required field is left empty.

                          <td class="newvalue">Hi Toby, yes I think I agree with you, it reminds me of when I install new Android apps on my phone, some of them start off by bothering me with some sort of guided tour or long instructional text, I hate this and always skip through without reading it, expecting to be able to figure out the interface for myself.

The one thing that something like this could be useful is, rather than showing someone how to use the site, showing them what the site is capable of so they can assess whether it meets their needs/is something they're interested in. However, we already have a good guided tour of this type on ckan.org/features, those pages are really pretty good.

Close this as wontfix?

Browsers accept colons and slashes happily, which is the main usage of our links. The URL looks better with the colons and slashes, rather than the encoded version. The average departmental user doesn't understand that the reason to encode them is for some academic RFC and RDF which is not "liberal in what it accepts". Since the RDF tool has a satisfactory way to encode links, this problem is essentially solved. Therefore I'm changing ckanext-archiver to accept these unencoded links, I'm afraid.

https://bitbucket.org/Stiivi/dataproxy

I've refactored it and moved transformations into separate modules. For each resource type there should be a module in transform/&lt;type&gt;_transform.py

Each module should implement ``transform(flow, url, query)`` and should return a dictionary
as a result.

Existing modules:

* transform/csv_transform - CSV files
* transform/xls_transform - Excel XLS files

if there is no resource_type module, HTTP 200 Error Resource type not supported is returned.

You can override URL file extension or specify type if extension is missing through type= URL option. For example if you have any URL that contains CSV data however the url is just foo.com/data then you can pass: url=http://foo.com/data&amp;type=csv

Note: Source refactored/updated in example/dataproxy, being tested by running locally localhost:8000.

 * No real documentation (other than that in this ticket yet available)
  * It would also be nice to know how this maps to SOLR API (can i use all of the facet options solr provides or not ...?)
  * And I would again emphasize my preference for having *direct* access to something that looks *exactly* like SOLR API as I can then use client and docs from SOLR to work with it.
 * No clear resolution of separation between Action and REST API (and search API). Really seems to me there should be convergence between latter 2 (as suggested in the ticket) -- this would also resolve the problem that having GET /api/dataset return all datasets is *not* a great idea
 * The Action API requires a POST request. Since the primary purpose of the search API would be usage from JS it would be nice if GET and JSONP were supported. (Though given our CORS support we could argue this was optional).

Not saying *all* of this needs fixing but some clear approach here would be useful

Yes, I agree with all this, but as initial thoughts I suggest that for phase 1, the info() method returns one more key called "form_config_interface" which takes a string representing a the type of interface for the config field on the form. If the key is missing it is treated as "None".

The two possible values are:

None - the field is not present and must always be stored as NULL
Text - a single text field will be provided on the interface

Whatever the interface, the value built will always be stored in the config column of the table.

We then also provide a "get_schema()" method that returns a schema cablable of parsing the data submitted by the form and storing it as a single key named "config". ckanext-inspire will then add other functions to the schema for URL etc so that regardless of what the harvest plugin does, the key fields ckanext-harvest are always there.

This then allows:
* Customiseable config interfaces
* Customisable valiation
* A consistent place to store config in the database

Sound good?

                          <td class="newvalue">Great proposal, here's my thinking:

 * The current VDM model (where we have things like a single package table which logs changes to a package_revision table) is very well tested and works well and we should only consider a radical change with good reason
 * Although we are making a move from *model objects* being the central components to the *logic layer functions* being the central components, there is no need yet to have the database structures we store (for revisioning or otherwise) start to look like the dictized representation. The logic layer itself is designed to do that mapping.
 * Since we do have this logic layer though, there is less need for "magic" SQLAlchemy objects to support dicts and lists (eg the stateful objects used to make a list of tags on a package behave like a list), a few simple (and easily debuggable) queries in the logic layer would work better.

In the longer term we may want to look at serialising more dictized-looking objects and that may lend itself to a more dictized changeset model or even a more dictized storage system (eg no-SQL) but for the time being we are not at that point.

I recommend the following:

 * We continue to use the current default branch of VDM (not the changeset branch)
 * We continue to treat the package table (and other non-revision tables) as the most recent revision (even though the *active* revision displayed in CKAN might well be in the revision tables because more recent changes haven't been moderated yet)
 * We slowly stop using stateful lists and dicts in CKAN because we have move control with explicit queries in the logic layer

Sound good?

We want the interface for updating an object to be loosely coupled to
 the method for updating it.

We might update a Package from:

 - HTML forms
 - a REST API (using JSON)
 - a CLI (potentially using command line arguments, YaML, XML or ini files)

Right now, data is validated using a form framework, even if we're not
using forms.  Data is written to the object as part of the forms
framework (using the "sync()" method), making the process hard to
customise and hard to discover.

Instead, there should be a standard chain for:

 - deserialising untyped data (such as that received from an HTTP POST
   or parsed from a YaML file) into valid data
 - returning structured errors suitable for displaying to the user
 - saving the validated, deserialised data

Ideally, it would look something like:

  schema = MySchemaDefinition()
  raw_data = open("raw.csv", "r").read()
  structured_data = to_python(raw_data, schema)
  try:
     validated = validate(python_data)
     myobject.update_from_dict(validated)
     return "Updated OK"
  except ValidationError, e:
     return "Error: %s" % e.to_dict()

The inverse would be something like:
 
  structured_data = myobject.render_to_dict()
  raw_data.write(to_csv(structured_data, schema)
  print "Wrote CSV %s" % to_logformat(serialized_data, schema)

The question of how to generate and display forms should be completely
decoupled from this.  It should be easy to write forms by hand, which
means it should be simple to flatten the serialized data to key, value
pairs, and match up any validation errors to each key.

Optionally, a form widget generation framework is a nice-to-have, but
not essential, as it is expected that, given enough time, the majority
of forms will require manual coding to accomodate edge conditions.

A form widget generation framework should be reasonably complete if
it's worth trying at all, which means it should support things like:

 - nested fields (at least repeating, multi-value fieldsets)
 - widgets for dates and file uploads
 - internationalisation

...but note I'd settle for *no* widget generation

Components of a serialisation / validation framework:

 - a simple, obvious way to define a schema
 - a lightweight validation implementation
   - simple interface for validators
   - easy to match validation errors to data structure items

Overall, I'd like to see:

 - loose coupling, no framework dependencies
 - maximal test coverage
 - extensive documentation with readily available examples

## Findings

I looked at flatland, formencode, FormAlchemy, formish, WTForms, Django, web2py, deform/colander, formconvert and web.py

 - **web2py** just helps build HTML from python, so isn't what I'm after at all 
 - **web.py** has rudimentary validation which is only aimed at HTML forms and is hence tightly coupled with them. 
 - **Django**'s forms are again tightly coupled to HTML forms (and their generation)
 - **FormAlchemy** similarly couples validation to forms, and is focussed on inferring a schema from a data model SQLAlchemy.  
 - **WTForms** again focuses on Form generation and don't make itx easy to deserialise arbitrary data

This leaves us with Flatland, Formencode, Formish, Colander/Peppercorn/Deform, and FormConvert.

Having reviewed all of these, I rejected Formencode on the basis of its patchy documentation and relatively low unit test coverage.  I also found it mixed concerns a bit much for my taste.

Formish felt similarly sparsely documented.

Of the remainder, I'd be happy using any of them, but opted for Colander in the end as it has the most exhaustive documentation and unit tests and has been used in production for a long time.  FormConvert has a nice design but is a bit of a moving target at the moment -- worth revisiting in the future.

At the moment, some pages within CKAN tend to load slowly. We should create a profiling setup in which we can measure response times for complete requests and individual methods calls.

This could be used to identify bottlenecks and find an appropriate caching or tuning strategy to improve CKAN performance.

NB: We should also agree on a maximum request latency.

You could just copy it to /etc/cron.daily/, but i recommend to not run it as root: if it's misconfigured, it could wipe the system! 

So you better copy it to /home/okfn/sbin/ (not /home/okfn/bin/ which often is the sysadmin HG repo), and add it to some unprivileged user's crontab. In most cases, the leftover files are owned by user "www-data", so
 {{{
$ sudo crontab -e -u www-data
 }}}
and then add something like
 {{{
37 4 * * *  /home/okfn/sbin/remove_old_files
 }}}

Don't forget to edit the script remove_old_files itself and list the directories you want to be cleaned up.

This is already done on s008/eu8 and s019/eu19. dread, do you want to do this for s025/eu25 and see how this goes?

Todo nils: verify tomorrow on s019 that it worked properly, e.g. this should show only a few files:
 {{{
find /var/lib/ckan/nederland/data/sessions/ -type f -amin +$((7*24*60)) -ls

I've added DELETE to the Access-Control-Allow-Methods on the server, so you can try that now.

I've added a failing test for the problem of deleting the last extra. Am discussing with David Raznick how to fix that best.

I think the only other ones left to address are: 
 * Relationships use "object" key rather than id or package_id.
 * underscore in search parameters
