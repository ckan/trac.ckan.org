However, the resource extra field keys are defined in config option "ckan.extra_resource_fields". This config option should be removed - extras need to be entirely flexible for our purposes. (In the next ticket we should make it possible to add/remove both keys and values from the Web UI or API.)

It would also be good to tidy things in this direction: http://wiki.okfn.org/Coding_Standards

I've merged from default to the branch enhancment_826_resource_extra_fields ready for you.

* last-status
* last-crawled
* last-etag
* last-expires
* last-md5
* failure-count
* fall-back-url

These are things needed to really archive the data well, but they have nothing to do with CKAN core ops. Essentially, the archiver is a seperate concern and it need not appear in the CKAN config.

The config option is to add some fields that act in exactly the same way as python attributes, having the same semantics as them.  i.e if you have an extra field called alturl, you can do obj.alturl = 'fdsffs'.   

This is the best of both worlds as far as I can tell.

Let me explain in more detail: we would move to having one and only one pip-requirements.txt in the repo at any given revision and it would simply have the correct info for whatever branch/revision it was on. At the moment we are having extra pip-requirements-....txt for labelling branch pip-requirements when we could just the branching facility of mercurial.

This means the creation of the CSW server extension is now a high priority but it only needs to know about documents in the harvested_documents table. I've already implemented a REST API to get the those documents (but depending on the implementation it may need changing).

Other ideas:

* The apps will need an image upload
* We might like a voting system for apps and ideas, potentially that could be re-used later. 

Let's discuss the above ideas after the basic functionality is in place.

                          <td class="newvalue">Kindly, I agree - it would be much preferable to have independent storage for plugins and this would be easy to do if we were using another type of storage already. As it stands, however, our storage mechanism is SQL. I think we should use it for what it is as much as possible and do the weird, vertical stuff (k,v tables, swapping to redis) only if we really need it. For everything else: lets use SQL as it was intended. 

Examples: 

 * We want to develop an apps catalogue as a CKAN plugin. While we could certainly put this in Redis, there is no reason why we can't have the following table: application (id, name, title, description, author, project_url, site_url, code_url, image).
 * A watchlist plugin could essentially work on UUIDs alone. What you'd end up with is something like this: watch (id, user, scope_id). 

Re migrations you're right, but my first intention would be to handle that seperatly for each plugin (i.e. they need to have their own migration repositories that they keep track of, e.g. via an apps_migrate_version table)

                          <td class="newvalue">I do not think we need to 'extend the model' if you intend to make the migrations separate. If the schema is decoupled, then there are no problems.  So each plugin can have its own model and use sqlalchemy independently i.e have their own metadata, classes and mappers.  They do not have to even use sqlalchemy.

What I mean is that there is no need to do anything apart from.

 * Agree on a naming convention of the plugin tables (including their own migrate table each)
 * Agree to the rule that no plugin can add a column to an existing table.
 * Agree that no table can have a (database level) foreign key constraint between the core tables and itself in either direction.  They *can* have implied sqlalchemy level joins.
 * Maybe have a hook that on db upgrade all plugins are upgraded.

Each plugin will have to redefine the tables, classes and mappers they need to join onto the core tables themselves. reusing/extending the core model will not be worth the trouble.

This seems to cover your use cases and this way everything is nicely decoupled. Best of all there is very little work to do...

Yet looking at the dump from 17/11/10 when this ticket was created, the resource didn't have a URI, which by the current model is a requirement, so it suggests the data was fine underneath, but it had problems displaying this field, and is now fixed.

                          <td class="newvalue">Goals: 

We want the interface for updating an object to be loosely coupled to
 the method for updating it.

We might update a Package from:

 - HTML forms
 - a REST API (using JSON)
 - a CLI (potentially using command line arguments, YaML, XML or ini files)

Right now, data is validated using a form framework, even if we're not
using forms.  Data is written to the object as part of the forms
framework (using the "sync()" method), making the process hard to
customise and hard to discover.

Instead, there should be a standard chain for:

 - deserialising untyped data (such as that received from an HTTP POST
   or parsed from a YaML file) into valid data
 - returning structured errors suitable for displaying to the user
 - saving the validated, deserialised data

Ideally, it would look something like:

  schema = MySchemaDefinition()
  raw_data = open("raw.csv", "r").read()
  structured_data = to_python(raw_data, schema)
  try:
     validated = validate(python_data)
     myobject.update_from_dict(validated)
     return "Updated OK"
  except ValidationError, e:
     return "Error: %s" % e.to_dict()

The inverse would be something like:
 
  structured_data = myobject.render_to_dict()
  raw_data.write(to_csv(structured_data, schema)
  print "Wrote CSV %s" % to_logformat(serialized_data, schema)

The question of how to generate and display forms should be completely
decoupled from this.  It should be easy to write forms by hand, which
means it should be simple to flatten the serialized data to key, value
pairs, and match up any validation errors to each key.

Optionally, a form widget generation framework is a nice-to-have, but
not essential, as it is expected that, given enough time, the majority
of forms will require manual coding to accomodate edge conditions.

A form widget generation framework should be reasonably complete if
it's worth trying at all, which means it should support things like:

 - nested fields (at least repeating, multi-value fieldsets)
 - widgets for dates and file uploads
 - internationalisation

...but note I'd settle for *no* widget generation

Components of a serialisation / validation framework:

 - a simple, obvious way to define a schema
 - a lightweight validation implementation
   - simple interface for validators
   - easy to match validation errors to data structure items

Overall, I'd like to see:

 - loose coupling, no framework dependencies
 - maximal test coverage
 - extensive documentation with readily available examples

## Findings

I looked at flatland, formencode, FormAlchemy, formish, WTForms, Django, web2py, deform/colander, formconvert and web.py

 - **web2py** just helps build HTML from python, so isn't what I'm after at all 
 - **web.py** has rudimentary validation which is only aimed at HTML forms and is hence tightly coupled with them. 
 - **Django**'s forms are again tightly coupled to HTML forms (and their generation)
 - **FormAlchemy** similarly couples validation to forms, and is focussed on inferring a schema from a data model SQLAlchemy.  
 - **WTForms** again focuses on Form generation and don't make itx easy to deserialise arbitrary data

This leaves us with Flatland, Formencode, Formish, Colander/Peppercorn/Deform, and FormConvert.

Having reviewed all of these, I rejected Formencode on the basis of its patchy documentation and relatively low unit test coverage.  I also found it mixed concerns a bit much for my taste.

Formish felt similarly sparsely documented.

Of the remainder, I'd be happy using any of them, but opted for Colander in the end as it has the most exhaustive documentation and unit tests and has been used in production for a long time.  FormConvert has a nice design but is a bit of a moving target at the moment -- worth revisiting in the future.

{{{
stable: stable code
metastable: (will soon be deprecated) for code preparing to be stable
default: development HEAD
}}}
which I prefer. 

My ideal would be to get rid of the confusing name 'metastable' and unneeded 'stable' and start a new branch called 'released', which will act the same as 'master' in this diagram but with a more intuitive name:
http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model

Then for each ckan instance we can either use the most recent release (from 'released') or choose a specific one (e.g. 'ckan-1.3' or even 'default' or 'enh-865' for getting latest features). This gives a good degree of flexibility, is more understandable to newbies and probably a more widely understood branching model.

I am currently focusing on getting the rest of the UI in place and trying to determine the best way to get colander to do the desired validation beyond ensuring the form has all the elements. After todays work, I will push what I've done and I would like to walk through the design with someone at some point.

Work that remains:

 * Add download click tracking to individual download links (currently we just record page views for packages, not downloads)
 * Somehow cache the download stats against each package (the Google API is very slow); package reddis or sqlite or similar as a local storage for the extension
 * Expose download information in the relevant places in the UI (all users? package owners? where?)

This is about 2 days' work.  Unlikely to get it done in this sprint.
