By thinking of it this way in the first instance, we effectively get a read-only copy of other data in CKAN but one which will be kept up to date.

Marking as duplicate. Discussion can now carry on via #987 Common harvesting framework.

Not checking for hash value in headers. This process will generally only run when a new resource is added or someone updates a URL, so we don't expect to be regularly downloading the same resource. 

We will need something along these lines if this is running as a regular cron job, but in that case the logic will be added to the cron job itself (probably a paster command).

* tests added with configurable list of known URLs

* use brewery for transformations (included reference to brewery framework in a new vendor directory)
* side effect: code to make google find external packages in vendor directory (from now on, all external packages should go there and be referenced from .hgsub if they are mercurial repositories)

* changed response contents: moved from 'headers' to root, renamed 'response' to 'data', added field list as 'fields'
* changed way of registering transformers (now class object is used instead of name)
* added 'encoding' and 'dialect' parameters for CSV
* added optional data audit (parameter 'audit')

Changes in relation to Dataproxy / Dataapi:
* Currently only supports CSV files, but plans to add support for excel and google docs spreadsheets soon.
* Uses David Raznick's CSV parser instead of Brewery for parsing, handles messy CSV data better.

Changes in relation to old QA functionality:
* decoupled archiving (downloading) and QA process
* added a new 'process' command which parses downloaded files and adds them to a local webstore

Closing for now, any improvements/feature requests should be in tickets relating to either the QA functionality or the webstore.

At the moment we are not adding migrations to remove the harvesting tables. We are designing a harvesting refactor and will write migrations once the refactor is complete so that instances that use harvesting get upgraded, and those that don't get their harvesting tables removed.

Also, see this #1030 for the moving harvesting out of the REST API.

== nested transactions ==

VDM does not support sqlite, as it uses nested transactions.  I do not think vdm needs nested transactions. It can use a flush instead.  Here is the patch that works. All vdm tests pass.

== indexes ==

The index file 021_postgres_upgrade.sql in the migrate repository will not run as it uses syntax particular to postgres. Another will need to be made thats similar. sqlite does not support complex indexes like upper(text), so a work around will need to be found.

== unicode ==

The harvesting returns utf8 encoded strings and pysqlite dbapi only supports python unicode objects (as far as I can tell).  There will need to be a process in converting all strings that get into the database with string.decode("utf8")

== dates ==

Have not looked into this one too much. However, as sqlite stores everything as strings the timestamps appear to be failing on conversion back into python.

I have solved the above two issues before by adding attribute extensions to sqlalchemy mappers to do the conversions without effecting too much code.

== in memory sqlite ==

Some tests need to change in order to make sure the database is created first because the database gets lost each time.  In the tests that I have made pass, they run in about a seventh of the time as they do on postgres. 

== Other things to keep in mind. ==

 * Need a new flag in test.ini to remove full text indexing completely, or always use it with solr.
 * There are enough incompatibilities between the databases that you would also want to test against postgres as well, at least before a release.  
 * I would probably upgrade sqlalchemy first, so you will not have to the changes twice. The new versions are significantly faster too.
 * I have submitted a patch to #868 that makes the tests run about 2.5 times as fast and I think there are more low hanging fruit if the aim is test speed.

Re. nested transactions.  I am getting repeated non-deterministic test failures against sqlite (and indeed postgres, but these failures appear more frequent against sqlite).  One of them I seemed to be able to get rid of by eliminating the savepoint as per your first point.  However, it appears that sqlite [http://www.sqlite.org/lang_savepoint.html does] support savepoints; to demonstrate it, the following test code appears to work in the latest sqlalchemy:

{{{
#!python
from sqlalchemy import *
from sqlalchemy.orm import *

db = create_engine('sqlite:///')

metadata = MetaData(db)

users = Table('users', metadata,
    Column('user_id', Integer, primary_key=True),
    Column('name', String(40)),)
users.create()

class User(object):
    pass

usermapper = mapper(User, users)

Session = sessionmaker()
session = Session()

fred = User()
fred.name = "Fred"

sue = User()
sue.name = "Sue"

amy = User()
amy.name = "Amy"

session.add(fred)
session.add(amy)
session.begin_nested()
session.add(sue)
session.rollback()
session.commit()
assert session.query(User).count() == 2
print "OK"

}}}

So, while I agree they're not needed, I'm not sure they're a problem.  What do you think?  Also, have you seen non-deterministic test errors like this?

Here is an [http://groups.google.com/group/sqlalchemy/browse_thread/thread/dc9d1b61044bf730/65a62a33ec313842?lnk=gst&amp;q=no+such+savepoint#65a62a33ec313842 example] even though its a bit old. 

I did get some non deterninistic errors, the above seemed to fix them. A failed subtransaction is not handled well by sqlalchemy and I think this causes knockon effects due to the unresolved transaction.  I would stay well clear of them entirely if possible.

What are the errors you are getting??


My 2 cents. ignore me at will...

I would think about using a different backend for testing than production. [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2716847/sqlalchemy-sqlite-for-testing-and-postgresql-for-development-how-to-port look here].
If you want to support both then you should test on both. 
There are simple ways to scrape a few more minutes off the tests.  If you want real speed, then a multiprocess solution (with a database per core) would be sensible if a bit tricky.

I don't really agree with the people in the linked discussion who say it's pointless testing against a different database from production.

The goal here is to make it easy enough for people to run as many tests as possible that they actually do so.  Even 15 minutes is too long in that case.  With sqlite we can get it in at under 5 minutes.  I would also like to identify the longest running tests (which I would characterise as "functional" or "integration" tests and make them run as a separate suite, and then encourage a culture of writing true unit tests before functional tests, so that running unit tests can happen in 1 minute and be part of the regular development cycle.

That's no replacement for also running *all* tests periodically, and also running tests under postgres, which we can continue to do on the continuous integration server.  

Longer term I agree that it would be better to run local tests against postgres too, but that will I think involve refactoring many of the tests.

&gt; Longer term I agree that it would be better to run local tests against postgres too, but that will I think involve refactoring many of the tests. 

Well there are two options

 1. refactor the tests
 2. refactor the code to use sqlite and postress

It is a value judgment as to which is more complicated. I personally think 2 is more complicated but may be wrong on that. The real danger with 2 is that you are needlessly adding complication to production code, with 1 you are only changing the tests.

Upgrading to sqlalchemy 0.5+ should happen first regardless.  You will need upto date documentation. 

There is another option too.  Put the postgres data directory on tempfs/ramfs and turn off durability [http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.0/static/non-durability.html here].  We would need a way to db init before the tests where run (or) at boot). This may be the best of both worlds.

Anyway Happy xmas!!

                          <td class="newvalue">Below is a patch to make the tests run at least 2.5 times faster (about 15 mins on my old laptop).  Instead of dropping the tables each time, it just deletes everything in them, using a low level connection.  All the tests pass this way. It's a surprisingly clean patch.  Here are a few points concerning it.

 * I tested truncating the tables but it's slower. If there are any big tables in the tests this way is the fastest (faster than drop).
 * The sequences (id columns) will start from where they left off.
 * I also investigated making postgres template database and cloning it, but the complication was not worth it. 
 * sqlalchemy iterates the tables in reverse dependency order, which make this possible.
 * I targeted rebuild_db as that what most of the tests I saw where using, however I have not checked all tests to see if they all are. 
 * There is a slight hack on the repo object to make sure it knows that "clean_db" is coming from the tests.
 * I refactored init_db for code reuse.
 * I have not done a version check. sqlalchemy &gt;= 0.5 do this in a different way as outlined in the comments.

This UI seems to be updated. You start typing the name, full name or open id of the person and it has a dropdown that autocompletes. This seems to be sufficient for Will's points 1 and 3.

Would be still good to have a flash message on account creation to encourage people to add personal their Full name. This is similar to #1413 so I'll close this ticket and add it there.

Actually rather than expanding the form, you will go away to the login page and come back to see the expanded form (question: how does this redirect you back to the bottom?)

] That's the proxy_cache decorator which sets a Beaker expiry time only.
] Whether that is on or off, you still end up run the
] "etag_cache(cache_key)" command in the package controller won't you?
] And won't that will either insert the Etags header or abort 304 for a
] repeat? I must admit I've not tried it, asking purely with the code in
] front of me and welcome you pointing out where I've gone wrong.

ww:

Right. So those etag calls predate the cache decorators and should
probably be either moved up into the decorator (e.g. use @ckan_cache
instead of @proxy_cache) or wrapped in a check for the config
parameter. (And @ckan_cache could be changed to use pylons' etag_cache
function rather than just setting the header...)
