 * No real documentation (other than that in this ticket yet available)
  * It would also be nice to know how this maps to SOLR API (can i use all of the facet options solr provides or not ...?)
  * And I would again emphasize my preference for having *direct* access to something that looks *exactly* like SOLR API as I can then use client and docs from SOLR to work with it.
 * No clear resolution of separation between Action and REST API (and search API). Really seems to me there should be convergence between latter 2 (as suggested in the ticket) -- this would also resolve the problem that having GET /api/dataset return all datasets is *not* a great idea
 * The Action API requires a POST request. Since the primary purpose of the search API would be usage from JS it would be nice if GET and JSONP were supported. (Though given our CORS support we could argue this was optional).

Not saying *all* of this needs fixing but some clear approach here would be useful

https://bitbucket.org/Stiivi/dataproxy

I've refactored it and moved transformations into separate modules. For each resource type there should be a module in transform/&lt;type&gt;_transform.py

Each module should implement ``transform(flow, url, query)`` and should return a dictionary
as a result.

Existing modules:

* transform/csv_transform - CSV files
* transform/xls_transform - Excel XLS files

if there is no resource_type module, HTTP 200 Error Resource type not supported is returned.

You can override URL file extension or specify type if extension is missing through type= URL option. For example if you have any URL that contains CSV data however the url is just foo.com/data then you can pass: url=http://foo.com/data&amp;type=csv

Note: Source refactored/updated in example/dataproxy, being tested by running locally localhost:8000.

Browsers accept colons and slashes happily, which is the main usage of our links. The URL looks better with the colons and slashes, rather than the encoded version. The average departmental user doesn't understand that the reason to encode them is for some academic RFC and RDF which is not "liberal in what it accepts". Since the RDF tool has a satisfactory way to encode links, this problem is essentially solved. Therefore I'm changing ckanext-archiver to accept these unencoded links, I'm afraid.

The one thing that something like this could be useful is, rather than showing someone how to use the site, showing them what the site is capable of so they can assess whether it meets their needs/is something they're interested in. However, we already have a good guided tour of this type on ckan.org/features, those pages are really pretty good.

Close this as wontfix?

I'd suggest we add a generic "failed to login, invalid fields" in the error_summary block. Then more specific "this field is required" when a required field is left empty.

&gt; Longer term I agree that it would be better to run local tests against postgres too, but that will I think involve refactoring many of the tests. 

Well there are two options

 1. refactor the tests
 2. refactor the code to use sqlite and postress

It is a value judgment as to which is more complicated. I personally think 2 is more complicated but may be wrong on that. The real danger with 2 is that you are needlessly adding complication to production code, with 1 you are only changing the tests.

Upgrading to sqlalchemy 0.5+ should happen first regardless.  You will need upto date documentation. 

There is another option too.  Put the postgres data directory on tempfs/ramfs and turn off durability [http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.0/static/non-durability.html here].  We would need a way to db init before the tests where run (or) at boot). This may be the best of both worlds.

Anyway Happy xmas!!

However, I really disagree with getting rid of {{{from x import y}}}. In particular we have a strong convention of using this for ckan.model. It is a valuable abbreviation as it is used so much in the logic layer and tests. If someone should accidentally reassign the value of model to something else then I believe it is simple to see what has gone wrong.

The only thing that needs to be done is to remove all statefullness of relations.  These are the only things that are complicated.

This would make vdm just a simple copy on write mechanism, with the client controlling the state.

&gt; GET at root returns whole package set (a *bad* idea)

Sure it has a cost, but I don't see what the problem with this is if the list is cached. Forcing developers to paging through the list of packages is putting unnecessary obligations. I'd say that the top two RESTful operations are listing objects and getting a particular one, and you'd be taking away one of those.

Excluding Datasets that are state=deleted is a good idea. I've split that off into #1623

The other issues mentioned are simply data quality - the same whether viewing the dump or elsewhere.

So each plugin can have its own model and use sqlalchemy independently i.e have their own metadata, classes and mappers.  They do not have to even use sqlalchemy.

What I mean is that there is no need to do anything apart from.

 * Agree on a naming convention of the plugin tables (including their own migrate table each)
 * Agree to the rule that no plugin can add a column to an existing table.
 * Agree that no table can have a (database level) foreign key constraint between the core tables and itself in either direction.  They *can* have implied sqlalchemy level joins.
 * Maybe have a hook that on db upgrade all plugins are upgraded.

Each plugin will have to redefine the tables, classes and mappers they need to join onto the core tables themselves. reusing/extending the core model will not be worth the trouble.

This seems to cover your use cases and this way everything is nicely decoupled. Best of all there is very little work to do...

Names are changed only occasionally. The CKAN site adjusts all its links automatically of course. External blog posts may have incoming links, and these would break, but it's not difficult to search for a dataset. If we're really worried about this then we should provide a 'permalink' somewhere on the Package / Group / Resource page.

In the meantime, I suggest changing the Activity Stream links to be with names.

Let me explain in more detail: we would move to having one and only one pip-requirements.txt in the repo at any given revision and it would simply have the correct info for whatever branch/revision it was on. At the moment we are having extra pip-requirements-....txt for labelling branch pip-requirements when we could just the branching facility of mercurial.

The problem in the past was that the link was in the yellow box and there was no explanation as to why you had to login. This time you click from the header bar and there is a clear message saying "Unauthorized to create a group" - exactly as a user would expect. Even if the exact text of the ticket description isn't fully implemented in the current release, the UX isn't broken anymore. Yes, it might be even nicer to have a message warning them in advanced but these improvements will be taken forward in the UX work - maybe there is an even better solution than a message?

Since you are unhappy about closing it I'm marking it as "Duplicate" of #1521. As agreed earlier with the entire team, we'll take this forward as part of the groups refactor.

See #1521 for more information.
