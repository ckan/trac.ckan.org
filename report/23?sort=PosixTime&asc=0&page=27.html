&gt; Longer term I agree that it would be better to run local tests against postgres too, but that will I think involve refactoring many of the tests. 

Well there are two options

 1. refactor the tests
 2. refactor the code to use sqlite and postress

It is a value judgment as to which is more complicated. I personally think 2 is more complicated but may be wrong on that. The real danger with 2 is that you are needlessly adding complication to production code, with 1 you are only changing the tests.

Upgrading to sqlalchemy 0.5+ should happen first regardless.  You will need upto date documentation. 

There is another option too.  Put the postgres data directory on tempfs/ramfs and turn off durability [http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.0/static/non-durability.html here].  We would need a way to db init before the tests where run (or) at boot). This may be the best of both worlds.

Anyway Happy xmas!!

I don't really agree with the people in the linked discussion who say it's pointless testing against a different database from production.

The goal here is to make it easy enough for people to run as many tests as possible that they actually do so.  Even 15 minutes is too long in that case.  With sqlite we can get it in at under 5 minutes.  I would also like to identify the longest running tests (which I would characterise as "functional" or "integration" tests and make them run as a separate suite, and then encourage a culture of writing true unit tests before functional tests, so that running unit tests can happen in 1 minute and be part of the regular development cycle.

That's no replacement for also running *all* tests periodically, and also running tests under postgres, which we can continue to do on the continuous integration server.  

Longer term I agree that it would be better to run local tests against postgres too, but that will I think involve refactoring many of the tests.

Here is an [http://groups.google.com/group/sqlalchemy/browse_thread/thread/dc9d1b61044bf730/65a62a33ec313842?lnk=gst&amp;q=no+such+savepoint#65a62a33ec313842 example] even though its a bit old. 

I did get some non deterninistic errors, the above seemed to fix them. A failed subtransaction is not handled well by sqlalchemy and I think this causes knockon effects due to the unresolved transaction.  I would stay well clear of them entirely if possible.

What are the errors you are getting??


My 2 cents. ignore me at will...

I would think about using a different backend for testing than production. [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2716847/sqlalchemy-sqlite-for-testing-and-postgresql-for-development-how-to-port look here].
If you want to support both then you should test on both. 
There are simple ways to scrape a few more minutes off the tests.  If you want real speed, then a multiprocess solution (with a database per core) would be sensible if a bit tricky.

Re. nested transactions.  I am getting repeated non-deterministic test failures against sqlite (and indeed postgres, but these failures appear more frequent against sqlite).  One of them I seemed to be able to get rid of by eliminating the savepoint as per your first point.  However, it appears that sqlite [http://www.sqlite.org/lang_savepoint.html does] support savepoints; to demonstrate it, the following test code appears to work in the latest sqlalchemy:

{{{
#!python
from sqlalchemy import *
from sqlalchemy.orm import *

db = create_engine('sqlite:///')

metadata = MetaData(db)

users = Table('users', metadata,
    Column('user_id', Integer, primary_key=True),
    Column('name', String(40)),)
users.create()

class User(object):
    pass

usermapper = mapper(User, users)

Session = sessionmaker()
session = Session()

fred = User()
fred.name = "Fred"

sue = User()
sue.name = "Sue"

amy = User()
amy.name = "Amy"

session.add(fred)
session.add(amy)
session.begin_nested()
session.add(sue)
session.rollback()
session.commit()
assert session.query(User).count() == 2
print "OK"

}}}

So, while I agree they're not needed, I'm not sure they're a problem.  What do you think?  Also, have you seen non-deterministic test errors like this?

== nested transactions ==

VDM does not support sqlite, as it uses nested transactions.  I do not think vdm needs nested transactions. It can use a flush instead.  Here is the patch that works. All vdm tests pass.

}}}

== indexes ==

The index file 021_postgres_upgrade.sql in the migrate repository will not run as it uses syntax particular to postgres. Another will need to be made thats similar. sqlite does not support complex indexes like upper(text), so a work around will need to be found.

== unicode ==

The harvesting returns utf8 encoded strings and pysqlite dbapi only supports python unicode objects (as far as I can tell).  There will need to be a process in converting all strings that get into the database with string.decode("utf8")

== dates ==

Have not looked into this one too much. However, as sqlite stores everything as strings the timestamps appear to be failing on conversion back into python.

I have solved the above two issues before by adding attribute extensions to sqlalchemy mappers to do the conversions without effecting too much code.

== in memory sqlite ==

Some tests need to change in order to make sure the database is created first because the database gets lost each time.  In the tests that I have made pass, they run in about a seventh of the time as they do on postgres. 

== Other things to keep in mind. ==

 * Need a new flag in test.ini to remove full text indexing completely, or always use it with solr.
 * There are enough incompatibilities between the databases that you would also want to test against postgres as well, at least before a release.  
 * I would probably upgrade sqlalchemy first, so you will not have to the changes twice. The new versions are significantly faster too.
 * I have submitted a patch to #868 that makes the tests run about 2.5 times as fast and I think there are more low hanging fruit if the aim is test speed.

Here are a few points concerning it.

 * I tested truncating the tables but it's slower. If there are any big tables in the tests this way is the fastest (faster than drop).
 * The sequences (id columns) will start from where they left off.
 * I also investigated making postgres template database and cloning it, but the complication was not worth it. 
 * sqlalchemy iterates the tables in reverse dependency order, which make this possible.
 * I targeted rebuild_db as that what most of the tests I saw where using, however I have not checked all tests to see if they all are. 
 * There is a slight hack on the repo object to make sure it knows that "clean_db" is coming from the tests.
 * I refactored init_db for code reuse.
 * I have not done a version check. sqlalchemy &gt;= 0.5 do this in a different way as outlined in the comments.

Following irc discussion, it looks like read-only mode is simply
achieved by Apache config:
* 503 for PUT/POST operations - stops writes
* 503 for GETs to URIs containing: /edit, /create, /new, /authz -
stops providing forms that lead to a write
* setenv CKAN_READONLY="Undergoing maintenance 12.00 UTC for one hour"
which can be picked up by CKAN to be displayed as we see fit in the
future. Friedrich's current IATI sprint may link into this and grey
out edit links etc.

https://bitbucket.org/Stiivi/dataproxy

I've refactored it and moved transformations into separate modules. For each resource type there should be a module in transform/&lt;type&gt;_transform.py

Each module should implement ``transform(flow, url, query)`` and should return a dictionary
as a result.

Existing modules:

* transform/csv_transform - CSV files
* transform/xls_transform - Excel XLS files

if there is no resource_type module, HTTP 200 Error Resource type not supported is returned.

You can override URL file extension or specify type if extension is missing through type= URL option. For example if you have any URL that contains CSV data however the url is just foo.com/data then you can pass: url=http://foo.com/data&amp;type=csv

Note: Source refactored/updated in example/dataproxy, being tested by running locally localhost:8000.

Also very worth the thought of moving to postfix. It's much easier to configure and I haven't known it to have any comparable bugs in the decade or so I've been running it. In fact I've never seen anyone actually use exim before...

There seem to be are at least three monitors already in place: 
  * http://munin.okfn.org/ on eu1 monitoring eu[0-7] and us1, gathering additional health information via locally installed daemons. Munin's notification subsystem is not configured.
  * http://nagios.hmg.ckan.net/ on hmg.ckan.net monitoring the CKAN-HMG service group (network monitoring only). Notfications are not configured (or?)
  * We have a http://wasitup.com/ account which is watching some OKFN services (e.g. {ca,de,www}.ckan.org, {blog,www}.okfn.org) and sending loads of alerts to sysadmin@okfn.org. Only checking for "HTTP 200 OK" and whether the response contains a configurable string.


My 2ct: We should consolidate. What do we want?
 * A webservice like https://www.pingdom.com/ ($40/month incl 30 checks and 200 SMS, $0.5/month per extra check, $0.14-20/SMS) or http://www.serverdensity.com/ ($10/server-month plus 5-10p/SMS)? 
 * Or run our own monitor (nagios, opsview, monin)? 

In the latter case we want to have a separate machine which is not in on EC2 (but e.g. ByteMark), dedicated to monitoring only.


We should also include root mails into the alert/notification policies. Root mails should be trimmed down to important warnings and errors only.

Possible resource references:

- 'latest' - to be able to access 'latest' resource within package (or 'actual' or 'last'?)
- alphanumeric identifier (not starting with number)
- number - index of resource as human/visitor sees it on page (not the same as "position" attribute - as that one might contain gaps or be different (and it is in some cases)), index of resource should be something like:

{{{
SELECT package_id, id, url, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY package_id ORDER BY position) AS index FROM package_resource

}}}

                          <td class="newvalue">@thejimmyg: It is neat simple solution.

You have suggested a proxy API:

''There will be a new API at ``/api/spreadsheet?callback=jsonpcallback&amp;url=``
''

There are two options:

1. Have public ckan data proxy as stand-alone service: I get package resource URL from CKAN and pass it to proxy

2. Have ckan data API (as ticket title suggests): If I am talking to CKAN, I am getting data from CKAN, I should not care about proxy or anything behind nor I should care about original data source - I care about resource data in a format that I can process (CSV/JSON).

For CKAN data API I would suggest something like:


{{{
/api/resource_data/RESOURCE_ID?...

}}}

or more human readable:


{{{
/api/resource_data/PACKAGE_NAME/RESOURCE_NUMBER?...

}}}

This will allow others to get only CKAN resources. Moreover, allowing to get only resource data (not any URL data) would allow us to pre-process resources in the future.

First version/implementation: pass each requested resource URL to your proxy service (external, not CKAN related), which determines file by file extension in URL, fail on unknown file or unprocessable file.

/api/resource_data/PACKAGE/RESOURCE?output=jsonp&amp;sheet=1...

would be redirected to (for example):

http://1.latest.jsonpdataproxy.appspot.com/?url=RESOURCE["URL"]&amp;sheet=1...


Second version/implementation: Determine file type in advance and pass to appropriate conversion service when requested

If you upload document on scribd or slideshare it gets processed in the background. This can be done in CKAN after any resource change. We do not need to download the file at the moment, however what can be done is:

1. try a converter by URL file extension
2. try a converter by MIME type (content-type header)
3. brute-force try all converters

No need to store copies of files, just store determined file type somewhere in the resource record (as mime type).

Also, it would be nice if any data conversion service would provide output in both - JSON/CSV. Therefore we would be able to have "Download CSV" link directly in CKAN web page for browsing users:

/api/resource_data/PACKAGE/RESOURCE?output=csv...

notes field could use a WYSIWYG

 * No, Evan wants to discourage fancy features, plain text/markdown is fine
 * auto-complete on tags - DONE
 * department drop down options list interact with user permission - Evan building the API we need for this now.
 * licenses -&gt; drop down is fine, let's just OGL as default

So just default licence and replacing department with provider and via to be implemented on this ticket.

Evan will provide:

organisation.one() to look up one organsisation by ID

organisation.many() to look up a list of organsisation by ID all at once

organisation.match() to match a string and return a organsisation ID

organisation.department() to take a organsisation ID and return the organsisation ID of the department it represents.

Option A: store only mirrors of source files, have file format based plugins for querying files

Option B: store mirrors of source files, have plugin based loading scripts into "common structured format", have single query module.

I would go with option B as it is:

- easier to implement - file format based transformations are simpler than file format based queries
- more transparent data management process
- only one simple query module
(see attached  ckan-srcmirror.png)

The Option B will fit better to the broader data architecture context:

Concerning API I would suggest to try to be compatible with google spreadsheet API:
