                          <td class="newvalue">&gt;  * There seems some misunderstanding: change to have logic layer has almost nothing to do with being able to remove main stateful stuff in vdm. To be able to remove most of stateful stuff in vdm requires us to make some other changes (re foreign keys from revision objects to continuity)

The logic layer does not automatically help out, however it makes our life easier if we want to handle state ourselves.  For example take package tags, if we remove the stateful_m2m properties and just use normal sqlalchemy relations. We will still want statefullness (i.e active, pending, deleted) on the package_tags table. We should update those on the table ourselves in the  logic layer.

&gt;  * There are other simplifications we should make to vdm before embarking on this (e.g. move to SessionExtension from MapperExtension). This is easy as that work has been done in changeset branch and can be backported.
I agree but event thought the MapperExtension way is not great, it is very well field tested.

                          <td class="newvalue">&gt; Looking at the changeset, it now does a connection check at start-up of CKAN. If it fails then CKAN runs but doesn't show any
&gt; packages, apart from via the Tags interface, and the search page and widget on the front-page are removed. (BTW Is this a 
&gt; useful thing to do? Without search, perhaps CKAN should simply not start?)

When discussing the ticket we agreed that we should allow ckan to start without search. It is possible that people simply want to list/view information without searching for it and we decided not to prevent them from doing so.

&gt; I believe the problem pudo is referring to is temporary periods when the SOLR server is slow/overloaded/down. During this 
&gt; time pudo and I get exception emails saying connection failed for request.

Ok, other options then:

 * if an error occurs during search, return 0 results
 * if an error occurs during search, redirect to a generic 'search is unavailable' page
 * if an error occurs during search, retry the query a certain number of times before giving up and doing one of the above.

What do you suggest?

                          <td class="newvalue">&gt; Ok, I chatted to David about this and we feel it should go like this: notification to search indexer fails and raises an exception, 
&gt; this gets passed through the notification system back up to the code that creates the package, and you do a roll back. Does this 
&gt; tally with what you mentioned in the last comment or is what's there better?

This sounds good to me, definitely better than what is currently there.

&gt; Thanks for the info on the queue and ckanext-solr. It sounds like this isn't deployed successfully anywhere (or does pudo
&gt; know if it is?).

I'm not actually sure if the queue works or not, but if it does I'll have to write some tests for it before we could add it to core. A working queue system would be useful generally however, as there are other things that it would be useful for (such as QA), but yes, going forward the Solr extension should really be deprecated.

Good question. WIll add to description.

&gt; &gt;  New datasets can be created from the organization form, in which case the organization will be set in the dataset form dropdown (with privacy set to private - see below)
&gt; Does this mean like the setup on groups on the datahub (i.e. forward to new dataset but with some things hard-coded, organization/group?)? Or does it mean actual new dataset form on organization page.

The former, although currently we will have a slightly different form in the organizations extension, until such a time as we're ready to replace the existing one.  Tried merging the two forms but it ended up with such a mess of logic that it was unmanageable.

As the new extension guru/deity I say helper functions are the future - my word is the law


a) a missing helper just returns '' so they can be added to templates even when not implemented, a missing template gives a 500


b) helper functions hide the implementation which I think is a good thing


c) helpers are just soooooooo cool - plus they are new and shiny (what am I saying?)


As far as moving the phase I'm not too fussed we can be ahead on phase 4

The idea of this ticket is to separate TDH into an extension rather than it being incorporated into core.  This should help TDH by making it possible to push fixes without needing to do a new release of core.  It should also help make core more stable and as slim line as possible.  New features can be tested in TDH and then if they have a wider appeal they can be merged into core.

There is a strong desire for this within the dev team.

I've created some js translations note that they are untranslated except for zh_TW which is mangled.  At the moment they are just a json blob in public/base/i18n/&lt;locale&gt;.js


What more do you need? It seems to me that you just need either


`some_var = {json}`  or  `some_function({json})`


let me know your preference or do we want this purely as an ajax call?  If it's ajax I think we want a common approach like in http://trac.ckan.org/ticket/2698 which I prefer to a unhelpful response

I've done most of this

to test

get strings
{{{ python setup.py extract_messages }}}


mangle the zh_TW creates .po/.mo files - I may need to fix plurals
{{{ paster trans mangle -c .ini }}}


create .js files only zh_TW will be correct due to other .po/.mo files being 1.7 ones
{{{ paster trans js -c .ini }}}


/api/i18n/zh_TW should be correct


please note we do not have en.js I'm returning {} I think this is the correct response (maybe something else as we should just use the default _('...') strings - maybe we need to do something else


for what it's worth pojson does not provide the format you wanted so I adapted it

I've done this - it needs a bit of work ie breadcrumb and you won't like what I did with the css classes/js- a better solution is needed but this gives a quick example that we can improve on

the reason for this is that controller/package.py renders the form `package/new_package_form.html` as part of it's work and then makes this available a `c.form` to the template.  I'm not sure I like this as an approach but it is how it is currently done.  If you split your form into a new template `package/new_package_form.html` then you get all the errors etc.

I think for now we should do this and then look at if doing it all in one template pass might be more sensible.

reassign to me if you want me to do this else I'll leave it with you

@ross, templates_legacy are there for ckan users who have their own templates as we are completely rewriting all the existing templates

there is a lovely .ini setting to switch between the new and legacy modes

please note it is hidden in ckanext-demo also your `modal` think stops the link working - can you get it so that we open the href in a lightbox or somesuch.

I don't like auto submit as people may think (reasonably) that their changes are discarded.

We could catch all clicks and then ask the user if they've changed something but this feels a little crazy - better than the browser dialog.  hmmm

maybe we should discuss this ticket with the other backlog of undecided/unsure

personally I think we need to review the whole edit/view/delete logic as it feels real poor from my perspective - I need to edit something to delete it - that is a wtf imho

let's work out what we are doing before wasting energy on this

also while we're at it I'd also really like

form.input(...., help_info=&lt;something&gt;) that would give a (?) icon with a :hover {display:block} div - that make sense?

I'm going to leave this open for the moment but not make the requested change as I need to think of the best way forward.  The flash message error is quite hard coded into the logic and I need to think of a nice solution.

I've added a data summary

The data errors for empty fields are not happening due to our use of repoze.who for logins which is crap and doesn't provide feedback re loggin details so not possible without hacking repoze which i'm not doing.


Could you look at cleaning up the error summary we don't supply a field name (key) as not relevant it would be nice if we could hide the :  also removing the invalid fields message would be good to hide maybe add this as an option to the macro

I've removed the breadcrumb and got it to eat flash messages as these tend to be repeated at least
for some actions - maybe the flash messages is overkill.


Anyhow I think it's good enough for phase 3 and we should either say it is done or move to phase 3

I think this would benefit from some design from Sam at some point and I quite like a graphic on an error page to make it a little pretty but not any rush

To clarify this a bit.

We want this so that a extension can create a new template say dataset/read.html but rather than rewriting the `core` template in ckan it can extend it in the same way as {% extends %}.

The main difference is that {% ckan_extends 'template.html' %} would `walk` the ckan template tree rather than the extensions template tree.

Is that what we are thinking?

not quite sure what your problem was.  I had an integrity error on part 1 save which is fixed.

my issues

1) part 1 tags not saved

2) part 2 resources not saved

3) part 3 no form shown - i thought you had one showing where did it go?

will look at 1 &amp; 2 for starters

re flags it'd be nice to have more as the languages are not so fixed maybe that's too much work for this phase and is more wishlist

tags what functionality do we want for this?  I can just reuse the facet_list snippet but then we have all sorts of interactivity.  Do we want this more a static list of tags (linked to somewhere but no add remove stuff)? seems more sensible I think

this is as good a place as anywhere to answer your question about the c.form thing.

a) some of this we are sort of stuck with.  datasets for example can be of different types and have different forms for different datasets. so they need to be rendered separately.  I have no idea why or how much this is used but it exists as an option to complicate everything, not much we can do about it.

b) I think trying to do pages as a single rendering is not going to be easy because of the way ckan has been created maybe we can change this over time.  One major issue for me is that ckan does lots of crazy stuff for some reasons but these reasons are not apparent from the code.  Maybe there is some documentation somewhere but I'm not convinced.

anyhow we should maybe close this ticket now.  You've added some stuff in the comment for me to do maybe that should be added as a new ticket?

this is now in a snippet (jinja2 allows the selected="selected" more easily) needs some work still eg translation stuff and also maybe completely rewrite the snippet at some point.

Anyhow the functionality is there.  I added the button for no javascript working.

we need to have this styled a little better when non-js user

maybe it needs a little thought so that the lightbox gets a snippet and the non-js user gets the snippet embedded in a page so consisten styling and looks like part of ckan

 * 'Curated tag' (standard) Groups
 * Publisher workflow - http://wiki.ckan.org/Workflows#Moderated_Workflow
 * DGU setup

Suggest doing this either at end of http://wiki.ckan.org/Groups_Refactor, or perhaps better,http://wiki.ckan.org/Groups_Refactor.

I have disabled the sort order of group datasets in phase 2 as it is totally broken - I'll re-add it in phase 3

Also the comment you made you added bug2 - text covers order by box -PLEASE DO NOT DO THIS - all it does is make the tickets really hard to deal with - if this becomes a habit I will close all such tickets as INVALID as it makes trac unusable for developers - THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT - cheers

@aron,

can you watch for feature creep in tickets and let me know if it happens - thanks

I'm happy to discuss things on irc/email if you are unsure about things.


If There are tickets that you are not sure about when they are wanted, then add them to phase 4 as they can then be ignored for now - anything added to phase 3 is a "this needs doing now" thing and as we have agreed exactly what we are doing in this phase (last week) then adding new features will likely get a negative reaction.  So if not sure add it to phase 4 - aron and I may do some phase 4 tickets if we feel they will be quick and easy.


As I've said small things like the breadcrumb is wrong on page xxx or bugfix tickets are fine as broken stuff needs fixing.  Sometimes it may not be clear how much work something will be or who the person who needs to fix it is - so just ask first.


The main problem with this ticket is that it is unclear what the ticket is about.

I'm just closing this

a) Because the ticket doesn't really mean anything what is `properly` also a link to some random website does not help.  The ticket should tell me exactly what is wanted not be some sort of treasure hunt.

b) This is major feature creep - we have agreed the tickets for phase 3 small things/bug fixes are fine but this possibly a massive thing.  For weird stuff like this maybe you should save them up for when we have a meet up.  You need to get buy-in from developers I need to have some sort of pride in what I do.

c) I don't think this is a good idea from a technical perspective - maybe if you create a meaningful ticket it may make more sense.

d) Also I'm not doing anything involving maps till we have proper attribution of the map we are using on the demo site because I have morals, I thought okfn did too but I'm not sure any more.

Sorry to have to do this but it is for my sanity.  As I have repeatedly said the tickets are really important as they are the basis of all the work that I do.  They need to be of a reasonable standard.

It is much easier to work with tickets that only cover one thing - If something is found then the easiest thing is to add a new ticket.  If you feel it's related to another ticket then you can add that to the new ticket eg related to #1234

If tickets need combining it is easy for us devs to do it.  Basically adding something to a ticket is generally a bad thing.  Sometimes it's fair enough if something is missing for a new feature being reviewed etc - but even then a new ticket is generally not a problem.  Small tickets are nice to work on as we can close them quick etc.  The old [super] style tickets have been banned as they generally lead to owners becoming demotivated and unproductive.

It's always nice if you can find if a ticket already exists but I don't mind you opening a few duplicates if you can't find the ticket - for the demo you can probably just skim the tickets in the milestones as there aren't too many - but as you know I try to review them quite often.

Also please don't reopen really old tickets just add a new one If it's been closed in the last month or so then feel free to re-open if you're sure it's not just waiting for release - you can always check with the last owner of the ticket.

hope that makes sense

This is actually working correctly but the permissions on the server s031 are not what you want

I do not know how or where these are defined - he has package_update permissions from somewhere

maybe ross or someone knows

This is because you are a sysadmin - not sure why ckan does this but i'll look at it with the other group search tickets

moving to phase 3 as not a user viewable issue

can you review this http://s031.okserver.org:2375/harvest

The add/edit form isn't perfect

I have no idea how to use this extension so my testing has been limited

make a new ticket for any problems - Also for now we only care about major issues

@adriá

would be nice if you could also see if it's working correctly

can you try to work out exactly how to cause this problem starting with `add a dataset` and let me know how you break things

tell me all the fields you filled in - also try to get it to happen using as little effort as possible  eg 
add dataset http://s031.okserver.org:2375/dataset/new

title = mooooo

click next:add data

resource = moo
format = csv

click `save &amp; add another`


click on resource just created in sidebar to edit

change format to `HTML,`  

click `Save &amp; add another`


etc


that all works fine for me what am i doing wrong?
thanks

also please try using a non sysadmin account

this isn't really needed then!  there is no point doing work if we need to do it again editing resources is easy enough now anyway

I suggest we just close this ticket as a won't fix and #2705 as well while we're at it.

I'm also not happy about these being added to the phase 2 milestone when we are at the end of finishing it and these are not bugfixes or critical functionality

we actually need an extra state for full functionality can we create a new 'draft-complete' state as well?  does that need any additional magic?

It also makes it really hard to find stuff: as I add query terms to my query I get more stuff not less which makes for terrible finding of stuff - I appreciate that there is a scoring aspect but that seems secondary.
