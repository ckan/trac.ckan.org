 * Related is a pretty terrible name in the UI - much better to have it called Apps, Ideas etc (perhaps title tag could even give more details e.g. "Apps, Ideas, Visualization and other material related to this dataset") -- btw i thought this was in #2332 but realize it wasn't (apologies for that!)
 * Documentation, documentation, documentation - AFAICT I can't see anything in v1.7 or master docs. I imagine this would be a short section like http://docs.ckan.org/en/ckan-1.7/commenting.html (and probably coming right after that in the ToC) which says
  * What it does
  * How to enable (and perhaps includes a nice-screenshot!)
  * How to customize (e.g. can one customize the list of options of things one can create (e.g. can I set it to just be app and idea or ...)
  * Also liase with Mark W re a blog post about this from the user perspective (a screenshot walkthrough ...)
 * Clearly mark this old extension as deprecated from v1.7 forward: https://github.com/okfn/ckanext-apps (I just met someone last week who was working on integrating this and had no idea it was replaced by something better in v1.7)

1. clicking on a tag in 'top tags' takes you to old unstyled page, e.g. http://s031.okserver.org:2375/en/tag/economics. Should take you to search faceted by that tag.
2. I'd love to be able to link directly to e.g. the 'top tags' view - any way to do this?
3. Is there any way to rate datasets at the moment? If not, can we hide that option for now?
4. On 'Revisions to Datasets per week' can we rename this 'Dataset revisions per week' and can we change the orange icon/index in the table to 'all dataset revisions' instead of referencing 'packages'

Regarding setup to use unix sockets (as opposed to the loopback), I'm not keen, since it requires an extra step in editing the postgres config, for a barely noticeable performance improvement. Thanks for alerting us to it though, Florian.

I agree that it doesn't seem right in this circumstance, but the way I setup roles is for 'editor', 'anon_editor' and 'reader' to have a fixed set of actions. See comment in ckan/model/authz.py:

{{{
# These define what is meant by 'editor' and 'reader' for all ckan
# instances - locked down or otherwise. They get refreshed on every db_upgrade.
# So if you want to lock down an ckan instance, change Visitor and LoggedIn
# to have a new role which for which you can allow your customised actions.

Basically it seemed wrong when people changed 'editor' to something that couldn't edit. They should call that role something else. 

But people *are* able to edit these roles (even though they are reset on upgrade) and they should be prevented. I've put this in a new ticket: http://trac.ckan.org/ticket/1679

The problem is that the cookie exists in your browser, but it is not valid, for whatever reason.

The solution is to change the css/javascript that displays the Register/My Account bit in the corner to talk to Auth, rather than just check for the cookie.

At the moment they'll get a warning if they've edited the form telling them they'll lose thier changes. Perhaps we should submit the form using ajax, showing a spinner to the user, then send them on to the next resource.

This is the same situation as if we add an "add new resource" button to the listing.

                          <td class="newvalue">This ticket again brought up the issue of a need for inversion of control for writing to CKAN templates (main templates should really ask extensions for data or provide hooks rather than having extensions overwrite sections using genshi/jquery). Have decided to defer this issue for now, as it will be looked at when looking at making our whole extension system more robust early next year.

Related point:

 * We should provide a dashboard area (again via interfaces/hooks) that groups together report data from related extensions. So stats and googleanalytics info should be available from a similar area / url. This is also deferred until the extension overhaul/refactor.


Other outstanding issues:

 * Location / style of download count can be improved
 * Download count should be shown on resource pages

These should be looked at by whoever takes over frontend design.

                          <td class="newvalue">This ticket is essential I think. I would propose we should be a bit more radical here, though: 

 * Introduce an "Agent" SQLAlchemy object and derive both publishers and users via single table inheritance. 
 * Make agent the central object of authorization, e.g. by introducing c.agencies including the user account, visitor, logged_in, etc. 
 * Abolish AuthorizationGroups in favor of publishers. Yes, they are different but the use case for what AuthzGroups do and Publishers don't is just nerdery. 
 * Restructure URLs to be /&lt;agent&gt;/&lt;package_name&gt; rather than /package/&lt;package_name&gt; and have /&lt;agent&gt; be a useful list of managed resources rather than a revision list (users current home page).
 * Make Agents a primary facet for all kinds of navigation. 

Of course this would be done incrementally but I think we should agree on some such scheme as a marching direction.

See  what status people have by seeing small bits of info next to their  name, e.g. a sign to indicate being a superuser/sysadmin and/or the  number of datasets they have. I know the approximate activity and authority of users I come across

* Examples of put/post requests to resources and if they are needed.
* Dealing with resources that do not have a related packages in terms of authorization. Do they have a new action? how granular is the authorization? per resource? system level? etc.
* The rules related to authorization for resources attached to packages. i.e you only get read permissions when the related package has read permissions? do they have their own rules?

There is a different argument to upgrade older CKANs installed elsewhere, but there tend to be problems with extensions and themes not being compatible, so I think should be considered on a case-by-case basis and how much budget is available.

I suggest dealing with resources that aren't attached to packages in an entirely new ticket or CEP, as the implications are wider than this aspect of the API.
