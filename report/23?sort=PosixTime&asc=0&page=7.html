To clarify this a bit.

We want this so that a extension can create a new template say dataset/read.html but rather than rewriting the `core` template in ckan it can extend it in the same way as {% extends %}.

The main difference is that {% ckan_extends 'template.html' %} would `walk` the ckan template tree rather than the extensions template tree.

Is that what we are thinking?

I'm going to leave this open for the moment but not make the requested change as I need to think of the best way forward.  The flash message error is quite hard coded into the logic and I need to think of a nice solution.

I'd suggest we add a generic "failed to login, invalid fields" in the error_summary block. Then more specific "this field is required" when a required field is left empty.

tags what functionality do we want for this?  I can just reuse the facet_list snippet but then we have all sorts of interactivity.  Do we want this more a static list of tags (linked to somewhere but no add remove stuff)? seems more sensible I think

Toby, can you pull in the top 10 tags, as well as n of the most "popular" datasets and n of the most recent datasets. Actually just providing the functionality as helpers would be great.

Do we actually have "featured" datasets implemented at the moment?

Not sure what we're going to use for the box on the top left when on a new base CKAN instance.

this is as good a place as anywhere to answer your question about the c.form thing.

a) some of this we are sort of stuck with.  datasets for example can be of different types and have different forms for different datasets. so they need to be rendered separately.  I have no idea why or how much this is used but it exists as an option to complicate everything, not much we can do about it.

b) I think trying to do pages as a single rendering is not going to be easy because of the way ckan has been created maybe we can change this over time.  One major issue for me is that ckan does lots of crazy stuff for some reasons but these reasons are not apparent from the code.  Maybe there is some documentation somewhere but I'm not convinced.

anyhow we should maybe close this ticket now.  You've added some stuff in the comment for me to do maybe that should be added as a new ticket?

Just wondering about the use of the c.form variable to insert the form into the page. I know we do this with the dataset and groups to support legacy templates, do we need to do this going forward? I'd rather each action just rendered one template and leaves it up to that to render the rest.

Toby, there's a couple of TODO statements in the code where the breadcrumbs need fixing. I think the templates just need access to the package dict.

https://github.com/okfn/ckan/blob/feature-2375-demo-theme/ckan/templates/related/pages/form_page.html#L6
https://github.com/okfn/ckan/blob/feature-2375-demo-theme/ckan/templates/related/edit.html#L5

Also if you generate an error message on one of the forms (leave the title blank) the error string comes out wrapped in quotes. eg. u'title is missing'

Also might be of interest, I've converted the templates to use Jinja, and this is a good example of the conversion.

If things are hard to find we need to change our relevancy first.  So if you have examples of where you think the scoring is wrong then please make a ticket for that.

Google, I imagine, just has a cutoff of anything under a certain score not being shown.  We could do that as well but it would take some working out what we wanted that score to be.

Full "And" queries also limit any accidental discovery, especially of rare terms.  If you do not get your search exactly correct then you get nothing, which is bad.

Obviously you can still AND things or +things.

The correct solution to this is adding a minimum match parameter which is a middle ground. eg you can say that you want to match over half of the terms.  "thing1 thing2 thing3 thing3"  means you have to match at least 2. There are many options described here. http://wiki.apache.org/solr/DisMaxQParserPlugin.   You can change this in an extension if you want it just requries adding an mm field to the before_search in the Ipackage controller.  I do not personally think we should change it as default.

I am closing it as wont fix as its trivial to change and is a philosophical difference not a technical one.

this is now in a snippet (jinja2 allows the selected="selected" more easily) needs some work still eg translation stuff and also maybe completely rewrite the snippet at some point.

Anyhow the functionality is there.  I added the button for no javascript working.

I'm assigning to you for beautification etc

1. Did you have anything in mind for improving the "Powered by CKAN" text and icon?  I'll sort out the vertical alignment of the text and icon; and see if Sam has a better icon.  

2. The branded section itself is already customizable by a snippet (https://github.com/okfn/ckan/blob/master/ckan/templates/snippets/data-viewer-embed-branded-link.html).  Is that enough?  Or are you asking for something else?

3. Personally I think the URI should use the resource uuid, and not name.  And from recent discussions on ckan-dev, I think the consensus is the same.  How important is this for you?  Perhaps it's something that could be overriden in the datahub extension.
