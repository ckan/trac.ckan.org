 * Support plain text previews for many formats (including xml based formats)
 * Try to handle everything else as html with an iframe ...
 * Do not show preview button where not useful
 * Normalize formats for better recognition (e.g. text/csv, application/xls)

See: https://bitbucket.org/okfn/ckanext-datapreview/changeset/c1d672a6c368 and previous.

Also re-updated the dataproxy so it works again (had got out of sync when mistakenly reverted the dataproxy a couple of weeks ago).

Could still do api/sparql (using sparql js wrapper) and handle json (as plain text ...?) but these can be new tickets.

Let me explain in more detail: we would move to having one and only one pip-requirements.txt in the repo at any given revision and it would simply have the correct info for whatever branch/revision it was on. At the moment we are having extra pip-requirements-....txt for labelling branch pip-requirements when we could just the branching facility of mercurial.

Item 1 seems fine (what is difference from current extension mechanism?)

Item 2: concerns here. What about list views? What about editing 'permissions'? I also think getting rid of System object isn't really a benefit (if anything may be a cost).

Item 3: feel this may be better as part of big domain model change (also gives us time to really dig into this -- this is an important requirement/conceptual issue).

Item 4: No objections but seems very minor gain for fairly significant migration work.

Also I think we may need to do a bit more to clarify when you just do a good ticket and when one does a CEP (looking at what has occurred already). I think this may be one reason to keep CEPs separate in drafting from trac as will clearly distinguish CEPs from standard tickets.

Some general conclusions relevant to both:

 * General feeling is not to change to changeset model
  * I'm personally +0 on changeset model
  * I would note main benefit is simplicity and orthogonality of changesets to core system. I also think cost of change is small.
  * That said we can simplify current model as well.
 * There seems some misunderstanding: change to have logic layer has almost nothing to do with being able to remove main stateful stuff in vdm. To be able to remove most of stateful stuff in vdm requires us to make some other changes (re foreign keys from revision objects to continuity)
 * There are other simplifications we should make to vdm before embarking on this (e.g. move to SessionExtension from MapperExtension). This is easy as that work has been done in changeset branch and can be backported.

What I don't see in this CEP as yet is any discussion of the complexities around pending stuff (e.g. do we allow multiple pending, do new edits get shown current or latest pending). I'll try and comment more on this but a lot of this was in original vdm discussion last summer.

 * Is this work going in ckanext-spatial?
 * What is being proposed here, I assume, is to automatically index those fields in our geospatial search.
 * Should we develop a simple display widget using google maps or similar (this is orthogonal to the WMS preview i think) which *just* uses the core fields. This is probably a separate ticket and possibly separate from ckanext-spatial extension.
