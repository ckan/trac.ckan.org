Some general conclusions relevant to both:

 * General feeling is not to change to changeset model
  * I'm personally +0 on changeset model
  * I would note main benefit is simplicity and orthogonality of changesets to core system. I also think cost of change is small.
  * That said we can simplify current model as well.
 * There seems some misunderstanding: change to have logic layer has almost nothing to do with being able to remove main stateful stuff in vdm. To be able to remove most of stateful stuff in vdm requires us to make some other changes (re foreign keys from revision objects to continuity)
 * There are other simplifications we should make to vdm before embarking on this (e.g. move to SessionExtension from MapperExtension). This is easy as that work has been done in changeset branch and can be backported.

What I don't see in this CEP as yet is any discussion of the complexities around pending stuff (e.g. do we allow multiple pending, do new edits get shown current or latest pending). I'll try and comment more on this but a lot of this was in original vdm discussion last summer.

Yes, I agree with all this, but as initial thoughts I suggest that for phase 1, the info() method returns one more key called "form_config_interface" which takes a string representing a the type of interface for the config field on the form. If the key is missing it is treated as "None".

The two possible values are:

None - the field is not present and must always be stored as NULL
Text - a single text field will be provided on the interface

Whatever the interface, the value built will always be stored in the config column of the table.

We then also provide a "get_schema()" method that returns a schema cablable of parsing the data submitted by the form and storing it as a single key named "config". ckanext-inspire will then add other functions to the schema for URL etc so that regardless of what the harvest plugin does, the key fields ckanext-harvest are always there.

This then allows:
* Customiseable config interfaces
* Customisable valiation
* A consistent place to store config in the database

Sound good?

                          <td class="newvalue">Great proposal, here's my thinking:

 * The current VDM model (where we have things like a single package table which logs changes to a package_revision table) is very well tested and works well and we should only consider a radical change with good reason
 * Although we are making a move from *model objects* being the central components to the *logic layer functions* being the central components, there is no need yet to have the database structures we store (for revisioning or otherwise) start to look like the dictized representation. The logic layer itself is designed to do that mapping.
 * Since we do have this logic layer though, there is less need for "magic" SQLAlchemy objects to support dicts and lists (eg the stateful objects used to make a list of tags on a package behave like a list), a few simple (and easily debuggable) queries in the logic layer would work better.

In the longer term we may want to look at serialising more dictized-looking objects and that may lend itself to a more dictized changeset model or even a more dictized storage system (eg no-SQL) but for the time being we are not at that point.

I recommend the following:

 * We continue to use the current default branch of VDM (not the changeset branch)
 * We continue to treat the package table (and other non-revision tables) as the most recent revision (even though the *active* revision displayed in CKAN might well be in the revision tables because more recent changes haven't been moderated yet)
 * We slowly stop using stateful lists and dicts in CKAN because we have move control with explicit queries in the logic layer

Sound good?

It appears that the WUI doesn't call these functions anyway. Left that as it is since we're planning to replace it.

The cli rights command doesn't appear to add the roles that it says it adds. Possibly because it's not doing the required commit? Reported this as a different bug.

from the web interface, russianfan can be added as an admin on warandpeace twice.

desired behaviour is that you can only add him once.

from the command line, you can only add him once, but if he's in there twice, you can't remove him because the command line bombs
desired behaviour is that he can be removed

from the shell, you can add him twice but can't remove him if he's been added twice.
if you try, it bombs.

The desired behaviour in all cases is that adding and removing are effective and idempotent in all three cases.

The idea itself is a double-edged sword. It will promote stability which is good but can also tend towards rigidity and stagnation which is bad. Each added bit of bureaucracy and process means fewer people will be willing to collaborate or participate in improving the software.

A PackageGroup is *just* a group of packages.

A UserGroup is both a group of users, and a thing affecting authorizations.

Perhaps PackageGroup and UserAuthorizationGroup? Or PackageGroup and AuthorizedUserGroup?

I was quite confused by all this at first.

I think I understand how the whole thing works pretty well now, and I still can't think of good names for the two concepts, although I can already feel the normal English meanings of the words changing to what I now know they are for.

We should be a little wary of this. Things that are even slightly difficult to understand end up being understood by very few people. Would any of us be prepared to sit an exam on exactly how UNIX file permissions work, even though we all use them?

For some reason it was not (completely/correctly) installed with ckanext-datanl on us4, but is a different issue then. Might be due to missing locale "en_GB.utf8" and dpkg-configrue failing.

 * Improved UI of upload including having ckan based file links (using redirects)
  * Set uploaded-by field on uploaded files 
 * Checked on AWS And GS

Also did:
 * Improved ofs in various ways including change to standard metadata handling and improved testing (see e.g. https://bitbucket.org/okfn/ofs/changeset/36fac29b7775)
 * Tracked down [https://github.com/okfn/boto/commit/0d9635c8a9785c9b20b44ee93a0679c002961592 bug with boto and metadata updating on GS] and provided patch.

Item 1 seems fine (what is difference from current extension mechanism?)

Item 2: concerns here. What about list views? What about editing 'permissions'? I also think getting rid of System object isn't really a benefit (if anything may be a cost).

Item 3: feel this may be better as part of big domain model change (also gives us time to really dig into this -- this is an important requirement/conceptual issue).

Item 4: No objections but seems very minor gain for fairly significant migration work.

* The source type and label should be part of the plugin, not named in DGU.
* Need warnings if a document changes but its date doesn't -&gt; do we have these?
* I noticed there are some tests in DGU, should these perhaps be in ckanext-harvest?
* If active is False, the job should not be put on the queue
* Log if the wrong type of URL is entered as an error the user can see
* Deny if the source is already registered
* Overwrite all extras, not just merge new ones.
* During the import stage use iswms.py to add an extra during import if it is a WMS so that we can add a link to the WMS later https://gist.github.com/900878
* Can errors/warnings be logged in the import stage? Do all fetched documents get passed to import in one go?
