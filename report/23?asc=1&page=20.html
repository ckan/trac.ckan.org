For some reason it was not (completely/correctly) installed with ckanext-datanl on us4, but is a different issue then. Might be due to missing locale "en_GB.utf8" and dpkg-configrue failing.

 * Improved UI of upload including having ckan based file links (using redirects)
  * Set uploaded-by field on uploaded files 
 * Checked on AWS And GS

Also did:
 * Improved ofs in various ways including change to standard metadata handling and improved testing (see e.g. https://bitbucket.org/okfn/ofs/changeset/36fac29b7775)
 * Tracked down [https://github.com/okfn/boto/commit/0d9635c8a9785c9b20b44ee93a0679c002961592 bug with boto and metadata updating on GS] and provided patch.

The API stability needs of a programming language or an operating system (e.g. fundamental building blocks that you don't expect to change often or radically) are very different from a web application. The plone one is comparable.

The idea itself is a double-edged sword. It will promote stability which is good but can also tend towards rigidity and stagnation which is bad. Each added bit of bureaucracy and process means fewer people will be willing to collaborate or participate in improving the software.

Overall, -1.

Also I think we may need to do a bit more to clarify when you just do a good ticket and when one does a CEP (looking at what has occurred already). I think this may be one reason to keep CEPs separate in drafting from trac as will clearly distinguish CEPs from standard tickets.

                          <td class="newvalue">Great proposal, here's my thinking:

 * The current VDM model (where we have things like a single package table which logs changes to a package_revision table) is very well tested and works well and we should only consider a radical change with good reason
 * Although we are making a move from *model objects* being the central components to the *logic layer functions* being the central components, there is no need yet to have the database structures we store (for revisioning or otherwise) start to look like the dictized representation. The logic layer itself is designed to do that mapping.
 * Since we do have this logic layer though, there is less need for "magic" SQLAlchemy objects to support dicts and lists (eg the stateful objects used to make a list of tags on a package behave like a list), a few simple (and easily debuggable) queries in the logic layer would work better.

In the longer term we may want to look at serialising more dictized-looking objects and that may lend itself to a more dictized changeset model or even a more dictized storage system (eg no-SQL) but for the time being we are not at that point.

I recommend the following:

 * We continue to use the current default branch of VDM (not the changeset branch)
 * We continue to treat the package table (and other non-revision tables) as the most recent revision (even though the *active* revision displayed in CKAN might well be in the revision tables because more recent changes haven't been moderated yet)
 * We slowly stop using stateful lists and dicts in CKAN because we have move control with explicit queries in the logic layer

Sound good?

Some general conclusions relevant to both:

 * General feeling is not to change to changeset model
  * I'm personally +0 on changeset model
  * I would note main benefit is simplicity and orthogonality of changesets to core system. I also think cost of change is small.
  * That said we can simplify current model as well.
 * There seems some misunderstanding: change to have logic layer has almost nothing to do with being able to remove main stateful stuff in vdm. To be able to remove most of stateful stuff in vdm requires us to make some other changes (re foreign keys from revision objects to continuity)
 * There are other simplifications we should make to vdm before embarking on this (e.g. move to SessionExtension from MapperExtension). This is easy as that work has been done in changeset branch and can be backported.

What I don't see in this CEP as yet is any discussion of the complexities around pending stuff (e.g. do we allow multiple pending, do new edits get shown current or latest pending). I'll try and comment more on this but a lot of this was in original vdm discussion last summer.

The logic layer does not automatically help out, however it makes our life easier if we want to handle state ourselves.  For example take package tags, if we remove the stateful_m2m properties and just use normal sqlalchemy relations. We will still want statefullness (i.e active, pending, deleted) on the package_tags table. We should update those on the table ourselves in the  logic layer.

&gt;  * There are other simplifications we should make to vdm before embarking on this (e.g. move to SessionExtension from MapperExtension). This is easy as that work has been done in changeset branch and can be backported.
I agree but event thought the MapperExtension way is not great, it is very well field tested.

Yes, I agree with all this, but as initial thoughts I suggest that for phase 1, the info() method returns one more key called "form_config_interface" which takes a string representing a the type of interface for the config field on the form. If the key is missing it is treated as "None".

The two possible values are:

None - the field is not present and must always be stored as NULL
Text - a single text field will be provided on the interface

Whatever the interface, the value built will always be stored in the config column of the table.

We then also provide a "get_schema()" method that returns a schema cablable of parsing the data submitted by the form and storing it as a single key named "config". ckanext-inspire will then add other functions to the schema for URL etc so that regardless of what the harvest plugin does, the key fields ckanext-harvest are always there.

This then allows:
* Customiseable config interfaces
* Customisable valiation
* A consistent place to store config in the database

Sound good?

&gt; This would be nice but it is not necessary.  The current mapper implementation may be nice but not is battle tested..

I meant the mapper extension "IS" battle tested.

The clients should be entirely state aware.

The only thing that needs to be done is to remove all statefullness of relations.  These are the only things that are complicated.

This would make vdm just a simple copy on write mechanism, with the client controlling the state.

Getting a package at a specified revision is really useful. This can be used:
* links in the package history (#103) (while in there, the 'moderated' flag should be shown in the package history too if not already)
* should also be added to the package API (as a replacement for the AJAX call?)

The history_ajax call looks like an almost duplicate of the Package Revision API. Can these be merged and put just in the API?

When discussing the ticket we agreed that we should allow ckan to start without search. It is possible that people simply want to list/view information without searching for it and we decided not to prevent them from doing so.

&gt; I believe the problem pudo is referring to is temporary periods when the SOLR server is slow/overloaded/down. During this 
&gt; time pudo and I get exception emails saying connection failed for request.

Ok, other options then:

 * if an error occurs during search, return 0 results
 * if an error occurs during search, redirect to a generic 'search is unavailable' page
 * if an error occurs during search, retry the query a certain number of times before giving up and doing one of the above.

What do you suggest?

A more difficult problem though is what to do about a failed search indexing. Because of the try/except catch we've had until the patch yesterday, we get no exception emails for this, but I'm worried that this has caused packages to not be indexed, and hence are essentially lost in CKAN (unless someone realises there is a problem and does a reindex at some point).

BTW I added paster command 'search-index check' for looking at this problem, but I don't think it was ever added to solr. Is it easy to add get_all_entity_ids for the purpose of checking for this problem?

Yes it is easy to get a list of IDs from Solr so I'll have a look at that command and make sure that it works. I think a case could be made for not allowing a package to be added if it cannot be indexed however, and making the user simply retry the request.

Was there not talk of changing the queue system recently though? There are also no tests for the Solr queue so that would take a bit of work as well.

Thanks for the info on the queue and ckanext-solr. It sounds like this isn't deployed successfully anywhere (or does pudo know if it is?). In this case we should be clear that it is not what it says it is: "This extension adds support for package search using Apache Solr to CKAN" and maybe simply mark it as deprecated. Pudo what do you think?

I'm not actually sure if the queue works or not, but if it does I'll have to write some tests for it before we could add it to core. A working queue system would be useful generally however, as there are other things that it would be useful for (such as QA), but yes, going forward the Solr extension should really be deprecated.
