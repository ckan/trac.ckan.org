= Immediate actions

 * analysis of whether the current action/get.py:package_search() function exposes all we currently need for the use cases described above.
 * how to return that data (expand the current format?)
 * analysis of whether the current (action) API v.3 can use query parameters rather than as well as POSTed data.
    (controlles/api.py:action() )
    uses "self._get_request_data()" which in-turn pulls out data from POST body.

= Tasks

Extend the existing package_search action.

 * pass the facet fields into the logic layer from the request parameters.
   - /api/3/action/package_search
 * facet information not being returned via package_search action (is empty).
   - curl -X POST -d '{"q": "{!lucene q.op=AND df=text}tags:health +community -profile"}' 'http://thedatahub.org/api/3/action/package_search'
   - figure out why it's not working, and what the facet information should look like
 * whitelist any GETable api actions, and optionally construct the query from url params rather than body

{{{
curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/3/action/package_search?q=police
}}}

or, for cases where a more complex data_dict is required, the data_dict can be parsed as a json-encoded dict in a single url-parameter called ``data_dict``, ie:

{{{
curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/3/action/package_search?data_dict={'q':'police'}
}}}

As part of this ticket:

 - I noticed that all module-public members of the action modules were being loaded as actions (including functions imported from other modules).  So I've cleared up the  action modules to prevent this.

 - I've cleaned up the action modules to use ``get_or_bust()`` when accessing a passed in data_dict outside before it's been validated by a schema.  This provides better error messages for clients.

 - provided a decorator, ``@side_effect_free``, for users implementing their own actions through the IActions interface to be able to expose their custom/overridden actions as a GET request through the action API.

 * No real documentation (other than that in this ticket yet available)
  * It would also be nice to know how this maps to SOLR API (can i use all of the facet options solr provides or not ...?)
  * And I would again emphasize my preference for having *direct* access to something that looks *exactly* like SOLR API as I can then use client and docs from SOLR to work with it.
 * No clear resolution of separation between Action and REST API (and search API). Really seems to me there should be convergence between latter 2 (as suggested in the ticket) -- this would also resolve the problem that having GET /api/dataset return all datasets is *not* a great idea
 * The Action API requires a POST request. Since the primary purpose of the search API would be usage from JS it would be nice if GET and JSONP were supported. (Though given our CORS support we could argue this was optional).

Not saying *all* of this needs fixing but some clear approach here would be useful

Another option is to have the data_dict json-encoded in the GET request's body.  This is possible, but

1) Although permissable, it's not, as I understand it, conventional to have a GET request's body form the options of the request.

2) Caching proxies won't inspect the body of the request, only the URL.

 * Related is a pretty terrible name in the UI - much better to have it called Apps, Ideas etc (perhaps title tag could even give more details e.g. "Apps, Ideas, Visualization and other material related to this dataset") -- btw i thought this was in #2332 but realize it wasn't (apologies for that!)
 * Documentation, documentation, documentation - AFAICT I can't see anything in v1.7 or master docs. I imagine this would be a short section like http://docs.ckan.org/en/ckan-1.7/commenting.html (and probably coming right after that in the ToC) which says
  * What it does
  * How to enable (and perhaps includes a nice-screenshot!)
  * How to customize (e.g. can one customize the list of options of things one can create (e.g. can I set it to just be app and idea or ...)
  * Also liase with Mark W re a blog post about this from the user perspective (a screenshot walkthrough ...)
 * Clearly mark this old extension as deprecated from v1.7 forward: https://github.com/okfn/ckanext-apps (I just met someone last week who was working on integrating this and had no idea it was replaced by something better in v1.7)

                          <td class="newvalue">I installed CKAN yesterday afternoon from source, using the instructions at

http://docs.ckan.org/en/ckan-1.7/install-from-source.html

Most things worked pretty smoothly and, luckily, when they didn't I
was lucky enough to have David Raznick on hand to help sort them out.
As a result I've made the following notes on where the doc could be
improved.

For some ghastly reason I am running Linux Mint, which is some variant
of Ubuntu. It's not 10.04, so no package, hence the source install.

Sec 2: Not wanting a mysterious file called 'pyenv' in my home
directory, I created a directory ~/ckan and typed 'virtualenv pyenv'
from there. Everything worked fine. But if I had needed the 'tip' it
would have been a little confusing. It would also be worth reminding
the user that the dubious package is one they've supposedly just
installed, so if that went OK, they won't need to worry about this.

The tip also isn't clear about under what circumstances I'd need to do
the 'easy_install pip' - I didn't need to (is that also only when
python-virtualenv is missing?)

Sec 4: This worked, but the example command for installing a
particular version is confusing. It says it is for 1.5.1, but
replacing '1.5.1' with '1.7' fails because there is a rogue 'c' in the
command.

Probably it would be better to use the latest version (1.7) as the
example anyway. Or is there a way of asking for the latest released
version?

I understand this checks out the whole Git repository with all history
- I can't imagine why I'd need to do this to build a particular
version. But David assures me it's very sensible.

Sec 6: This worked, but it wasn't very clear what the purpose of the
'List existing databases' step was.

Sec 8: So now I had to try to get Solr working using the instructions at

http://docs.ckan.org/en/ckan-1.7/solr-setup.html

This didn't work at all, in ways I can't now remember, to do with
Java. In the end David suggested using Tomcat rather than Jetty (don't
ask me what these do, but they have something to do with getting Solr
to work ...) and this turned out to be much more straightforward to
install and get working, with two caveats (below). David suggested
maybe Tomcat should be the default suggested in this doc.

- One problem with Jetty was to do with using the wrong version of
Java, which seemed to be fixed using "sudo update-alternatives
--config java". It didn't fix Jetty - not sure if it would also have
been needed with Tomcat.
- Soft linking the schema file didn't work - it seems Tomcat doesn't
like soft links. We made a copy.

After this everything worked, and I now have my very own CKAN. Hurrah!

install, "paster --plugin=ckan user add admin
--config=/etc/ckan/std/std.ini" doesn't work (the ini file is
somewhere completely different), but just typing "paster user add
admin" from the ckan directory is fine.

The instructions should also mention that the virtual environment
should be activated.

the reason for this is that controller/package.py renders the form `package/new_package_form.html` as part of it's work and then makes this available a `c.form` to the template.  I'm not sure I like this as an approach but it is how it is currently done.  If you split your form into a new template `package/new_package_form.html` then you get all the errors etc.

I think for now we should do this and then look at if doing it all in one template pass might be more sensible.

reassign to me if you want me to do this else I'll leave it with you

Resolution:

 - I've decided to keep the behaviour of not parsing UTC offsets because we currently don't store timezone information in the database; and I think that either dropping the tzinfo, or adjusting for it would appear to be "magic behaviour" from the user's perspective.  Also, as this is a helper function, I think it makes sense to keep the behaviour as is, even if it's slightly non-standard.

This fix [1] maintains all the old non-ISO behaviour:

 - not allowing UTC offset to be specified.
 - arbitrary delimiters between date and time values.
 - microsecond precision.

But won't parse "+0100" as microsecond precision.

I tried using a couple of python modules for parsing date strings; but none maintained the same behaviour.

===============
package_list

revision_show
group_list
package_update_validate

It would be nice to get this fixed and I'm loathed to suggest adding a version 4 hack.
If we make this change it will break things for existing users.  This behaviour has existed since the action api was added as far as I'm aware

So should we
a) leave it forever and document
b) break things and fix it - when 1.7.1 or 1.8?
