                          <td class="newvalue">This helper function won't parse UTC offset if passed a UTC offset as "+01:00"; but incorrectly parses the UTC offset "+0100" as 100 microseconds.

Resolution:

 - I've decided to keep the behaviour of not parsing UTC offsets because we currently don't store timezone information in the database; and I think that either dropping the tzinfo, or adjusting for it would appear to be "magic behaviour" from the user's perspective.  Also, as this is a helper function, I think it makes sense to keep the behaviour as is, even if it's slightly non-standard.

This fix [1] maintains all the old non-ISO behaviour:

 - not allowing UTC offset to be specified.
 - arbitrary delimiters between date and time values.
 - microsecond precision.

But won't parse "+0100" as microsecond precision.

I tried using a couple of python modules for parsing date strings; but none maintained the same behaviour.

2. The branded section itself is already customizable by a snippet (https://github.com/okfn/ckan/blob/master/ckan/templates/snippets/data-viewer-embed-branded-link.html).  Is that enough?  Or are you asking for something else?

3. Personally I think the URI should use the resource uuid, and not name.  And from recent discussions on ckan-dev, I think the consensus is the same.  How important is this for you?  Perhaps it's something that could be overriden in the datahub extension.

                          <td class="newvalue">I installed CKAN yesterday afternoon from source, using the instructions at

http://docs.ckan.org/en/ckan-1.7/install-from-source.html

Most things worked pretty smoothly and, luckily, when they didn't I
was lucky enough to have David Raznick on hand to help sort them out.
As a result I've made the following notes on where the doc could be
improved.

For some ghastly reason I am running Linux Mint, which is some variant
of Ubuntu. It's not 10.04, so no package, hence the source install.

Sec 2: Not wanting a mysterious file called 'pyenv' in my home
directory, I created a directory ~/ckan and typed 'virtualenv pyenv'
from there. Everything worked fine. But if I had needed the 'tip' it
would have been a little confusing. It would also be worth reminding
the user that the dubious package is one they've supposedly just
installed, so if that went OK, they won't need to worry about this.

The tip also isn't clear about under what circumstances I'd need to do
the 'easy_install pip' - I didn't need to (is that also only when
python-virtualenv is missing?)

Sec 4: This worked, but the example command for installing a
particular version is confusing. It says it is for 1.5.1, but
replacing '1.5.1' with '1.7' fails because there is a rogue 'c' in the
command.

Probably it would be better to use the latest version (1.7) as the
example anyway. Or is there a way of asking for the latest released
version?

I understand this checks out the whole Git repository with all history
- I can't imagine why I'd need to do this to build a particular
version. But David assures me it's very sensible.

Sec 6: This worked, but it wasn't very clear what the purpose of the
'List existing databases' step was.

Sec 8: So now I had to try to get Solr working using the instructions at

http://docs.ckan.org/en/ckan-1.7/solr-setup.html

This didn't work at all, in ways I can't now remember, to do with
Java. In the end David suggested using Tomcat rather than Jetty (don't
ask me what these do, but they have something to do with getting Solr
to work ...) and this turned out to be much more straightforward to
install and get working, with two caveats (below). David suggested
maybe Tomcat should be the default suggested in this doc.

- One problem with Jetty was to do with using the wrong version of
Java, which seemed to be fixed using "sudo update-alternatives
--config java". It didn't fix Jetty - not sure if it would also have
been needed with Tomcat.
- Soft linking the schema file didn't work - it seems Tomcat doesn't
like soft links. We made a copy.

After this everything worked, and I now have my very own CKAN. Hurrah!

as stated if you have done a package installation. E.g. after a source
install, "paster --plugin=ckan user add admin
--config=/etc/ckan/std/std.ini" doesn't work (the ini file is
somewhere completely different), but just typing "paster user add
admin" from the ckan directory is fine.

The instructions should also mention that the virtual environment

the reason for this is that controller/package.py renders the form `package/new_package_form.html` as part of it's work and then makes this available a `c.form` to the template.  I'm not sure I like this as an approach but it is how it is currently done.  If you split your form into a new template `package/new_package_form.html` then you get all the errors etc.

I think for now we should do this and then look at if doing it all in one template pass might be more sensible.

reassign to me if you want me to do this else I'll leave it with you

It would be nice to get this fixed and I'm loathed to suggest adding a version 4 hack.
If we make this change it will break things for existing users.  This behaviour has existed since the action api was added as far as I'm aware

So should we
a) leave it forever and document
b) break things and fix it - when 1.7.1 or 1.8?

Brief synopsis of changes:

 - altered return type of the action: from Resource domain objects to dictized resources.  This is required if this action is to be made accessible through the action api as the domain object is not json-serializable.  The 'old' return type is still available by passing in a flag in the context.  In fact, this is required as the search layer uses this action, and deals with the domain objects directly.

 - decided that escaping the ':' (as described in above comments) wasn't necessary as resource fields shouldn't have ':' characters in them anyway.

 - improved action's docstring

 - 'fields' parameter has been deprecated ( see #2603 ).  Use of it by the search layer has been removed in favour of the new 'query' parameter.  But it still works, and correctly maintains backward compatibility.

Toby, can you pull in the top 10 tags, as well as n of the most "popular" datasets and n of the most recent datasets. Actually just providing the functionality as helpers would be great.

Do we actually have "featured" datasets implemented at the moment?

Not sure what we're going to use for the box on the top left when on a new base CKAN instance.

this is now in a snippet (jinja2 allows the selected="selected" more easily) needs some work still eg translation stuff and also maybe completely rewrite the snippet at some point.

Anyhow the functionality is there.  I added the button for no javascript working.

I'm assigning to you for beautification etc

With the `order button` this is for none javascript users i'm not sure the magnifying glass looks like the thing to press to reorder the results.  I'd hide it when javascript enabled.  Do what you will

@ross, templates_legacy are there for ckan users who have their own templates as we are completely rewriting all the existing templates

there is a lovely .ini setting to switch between the new and legacy modes

Just wondering about the use of the c.form variable to insert the form into the page. I know we do this with the dataset and groups to support legacy templates, do we need to do this going forward? I'd rather each action just rendered one template and leaves it up to that to render the rest.

Toby, there's a couple of TODO statements in the code where the breadcrumbs need fixing. I think the templates just need access to the package dict.

https://github.com/okfn/ckan/blob/feature-2375-demo-theme/ckan/templates/related/edit.html#L5

Also if you generate an error message on one of the forms (leave the title blank) the error string comes out wrapped in quotes. eg. u'title is missing'

Also might be of interest, I've converted the templates to use Jinja, and this is a good example of the conversion.

this is as good a place as anywhere to answer your question about the c.form thing.

a) some of this we are sort of stuck with.  datasets for example can be of different types and have different forms for different datasets. so they need to be rendered separately.  I have no idea why or how much this is used but it exists as an option to complicate everything, not much we can do about it.

b) I think trying to do pages as a single rendering is not going to be easy because of the way ckan has been created maybe we can change this over time.  One major issue for me is that ckan does lots of crazy stuff for some reasons but these reasons are not apparent from the code.  Maybe there is some documentation somewhere but I'm not convinced.

anyhow we should maybe close this ticket now.  You've added some stuff in the comment for me to do maybe that should be added as a new ticket?
