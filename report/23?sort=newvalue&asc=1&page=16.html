If we want something more sophisticated, determine an appropriate fallback etc, then I think the API is the way to go. Or we could get CKAN to determine the appropriate language file and include it in the page source...

I'm also happy to leave both TestSiteRead and TestLockedDownUsage as they complement each other nicely actually.

So I think all that remains for this ticket is to add a paragraph to the authz documentation about SITE_READ. Pudo would you mind doing this? It's well worth noting where it applies and where it doesn't.

Creating the model dump file:
 * 'hg up' to ckan as it was at the last model migration
 * 'paster db clean', 'paster db init', 'paster create-test-data'
 * 'pgdump'
 * 'hg up default'
 * Check in the dumped file

Do we really want a script to mess with our repo like this? Isn't it just safer to do manually with good instructions?

I'm much more interested in things like:

 * Is this down (all the time)
 * Has this been down recently
 * When was this last modified (not quality per se ...)

This is an area where referring back to the original user stories (if any) around QA is really useful.

I guess my feeling would be some of this should be about providing e.g. helper methods so that theme designers can incorporate things into their design with some work putting this into default CKAN theme.

Also I think we may need to do a bit more to clarify when you just do a good ticket and when one does a CEP (looking at what has occurred already). I think this may be one reason to keep CEPs separate in drafting from trac as will clearly distinguish CEPs from standard tickets.

The tests have uncovered some inconsistencies in the use of SITE_READ between reading/editing a package in the Web interface vs the REST API. Friedrich, do you want to take a look at ckan/tests/functional/test_authz.py:TestSiteRead.test_pkggroupadmin_read for details and have a think about how this should best work. How about making SITE_READ more widespread in the WUI, to protect read/editing/searching things, in addition to the READ and EDIT RoleActions.

Once that is decided, it should be pretty easy to refer to the tests and document SITE_READ.

To reproduce it, you just have to edit the same dataset in both sites (production and testing). Just after editing the dataset, the search index will get mixed site_ids.

I checked the jetty logs (see attached files) and just after editing a dataset there are two POST requests to update the index. The request logs don't show the requests params so it's hard to tell what the second call does (it probably is the commit):
https://bitbucket.org/okfn/ckan/src/97e1e90d66d7/ckan/lib/search/index.py#cl-144

In any case, it's clear that the problem may be related with the datasets in the two cores sharing the same id. We are currently using the dataset id as uniqueKey in SOLR, i.e in our schema.xml, we are defining:

{{{
&lt;uniqueKey&gt;id&lt;/uniqueKey&gt;
}}}

According to the SOLR docs:
"If a document is added that contains the same value for this field as an existing document, the old document will be deleted."

http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SchemaXml#The_Unique_Key_Field

I would expect the uniqueKey not to be mixed between cores, but it looks like it happens otherwise. Maybe we should generate a solr_id specific to each document for each site, as described here:
http://wiki.apache.org/solr/UniqueKey#UUID_techniques

(Note that apart from the testing/production site use case, at some point sites involved in harvesting could also end up with datasets with the same id.)

Again, I'm not a SOLR expert, so the problem could be a completely different one!

Bootstrap allows us to delegate lots of clever functionality and layouts to Twitter's tried-and-tested code, making it easier to be compatible with IE7.

It has brought up plenty of issues: Lots of Javascript was broken; plenty of pages generate broken doctypes causing the browser to go into quirks mode (which in turn causes the page to explode all over the screen); most dynamic content would fail to generate properly in one way or another.... (see the #1788 branch for a log of issues encountered).

I've been refactoring our JS and have managed to strip ckanjs, too, because the only significant element we'd used was the File Upload view (which also now works in IE7).

test.ckan.net has been redeployed on master; I'm browsing the site in IE7 and everything is looking great :-)

                          <td class="newvalue">I've done some initial work on this.  I think the best way is to define extra tables in the datahub extension.  (Rather than: using groups; or modifying the user table; or defining extras for users (in core)).

Initially, I've created a new domain object, PaidService, which captures the different levels of account a user may have.  And then attached users to this through a secondary table.  I think the advantages of this approach are:

 - the PaidService table can contain supplementary info about that account type: eg - amount of storage allowed; or cost to sign up etc...
 - allows us to use a modular payment system if biz decide that would be favourable. ie - users belong to multiple PaidServices which are independant of one another, rather than a linear hierarcy (eg - "sign up for storage, but not for privacy" vs. "sign up for enterprise level rather than basic level")

The thing that's held me up today is being able to run tests: I'm having a sqlalchemy issue with defining extra mappings on the User table; which then gets dropped when initializing the test setup.  I've gotten to the bottom of the problem, and will ask kindly's advice.

In the meantime, I could do with some user stories please.  I think I have a fairly good idea of what's likely to be needed by this ticket; but to what extent should this be exposed to a sysadmin (adding payment schemes; adding users to payment schemes; users seeing which payemtn services they're paying for (public to other users or not?); user's seeing history of payments?  sysadmins seeing list of users for each service level?) - should this be: through a dashboard?  through paster commands?  through the api? all 3?

Do we want modular payments or a linear hierarchy of payment schemes?

How does is this suppossed to fit in with organizations?  Do organizations purchase on behalf of users as well as individuals being able to make purchases?

Do we need to be able to deativate a user's paid service if their payment hasn't come through?

https://github.com/seanh/ckan/compare/feature-1413-ask-users-to-add-email-address

I used flash_notice() to ask the user to add an email whenever they visit their account page, if they don't have one already. This means they'll see the notice when they login, because after login they are redirected to their account page. Issues:

Is it okay to approximate 'once they log in' as 'whenever they visit their account page' like this?

Do I need to do something to support i18n for the string I added? I looked at users of flash_*() elsewhere and they seemed to be hardcoding the strings in English.

Getting a package at a specified revision is really useful. This can be used:
* links in the package history (#103) (while in there, the 'moderated' flag should be shown in the package history too if not already)
* should also be added to the package API (as a replacement for the AJAX call?)

The history_ajax call looks like an almost duplicate of the Package Revision API. Can these be merged and put just in the API?

                          <td class="newvalue">I've now written a 20 page guide on using CKAN on Amazon EC2. I haven't explicitly created an AMI, but I don't think we should do that anyway for a few reasons:

 * it is fiddly
 * there is no advantage to the user as CKAN installation is so easy and so well documented
 * we don't want to have to maintain the image going forward
 * we might not want to promote a non-open approach

The guide will form part of Anna PS's work on the overall documentation but you can also see the original version here:

                          <td class="newvalue">Implemented, providing two methods of passing an action's parameters.  Either, each parameter is specified as a url parameter, eg

{{{
curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/3/action/package_search?q=police
}}}

or, for cases where a more complex data_dict is required, the data_dict can be parsed as a json-encoded dict in a single url-parameter called ``data_dict``, ie:

{{{
curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/3/action/package_search?data_dict={'q':'police'}
}}}

As part of this ticket:

 - I noticed that all module-public members of the action modules were being loaded as actions (including functions imported from other modules).  So I've cleared up the  action modules to prevent this.

 - I've cleaned up the action modules to use ``get_or_bust()`` when accessing a passed in data_dict outside before it's been validated by a schema.  This provides better error messages for clients.

 - provided a decorator, ``@side_effect_free``, for users implementing their own actions through the IActions interface to be able to expose their custom/overridden actions as a GET request through the action API.
