                          <td class="newvalue">I've done some initial work on this.  I think the best way is to define extra tables in the datahub extension.  (Rather than: using groups; or modifying the user table; or defining extras for users (in core)).

Initially, I've created a new domain object, PaidService, which captures the different levels of account a user may have.  And then attached users to this through a secondary table.  I think the advantages of this approach are:

 - the PaidService table can contain supplementary info about that account type: eg - amount of storage allowed; or cost to sign up etc...
 - allows us to use a modular payment system if biz decide that would be favourable. ie - users belong to multiple PaidServices which are independant of one another, rather than a linear hierarcy (eg - "sign up for storage, but not for privacy" vs. "sign up for enterprise level rather than basic level")

The thing that's held me up today is being able to run tests: I'm having a sqlalchemy issue with defining extra mappings on the User table; which then gets dropped when initializing the test setup.  I've gotten to the bottom of the problem, and will ask kindly's advice.

In the meantime, I could do with some user stories please.  I think I have a fairly good idea of what's likely to be needed by this ticket; but to what extent should this be exposed to a sysadmin (adding payment schemes; adding users to payment schemes; users seeing which payemtn services they're paying for (public to other users or not?); user's seeing history of payments?  sysadmins seeing list of users for each service level?) - should this be: through a dashboard?  through paster commands?  through the api? all 3?

Do we want modular payments or a linear hierarchy of payment schemes?

How does is this suppossed to fit in with organizations?  Do organizations purchase on behalf of users as well as individuals being able to make purchases?

Do we need to be able to deativate a user's paid service if their payment hasn't come through?

Bootstrap allows us to delegate lots of clever functionality and layouts to Twitter's tried-and-tested code, making it easier to be compatible with IE7.

It has brought up plenty of issues: Lots of Javascript was broken; plenty of pages generate broken doctypes causing the browser to go into quirks mode (which in turn causes the page to explode all over the screen); most dynamic content would fail to generate properly in one way or another.... (see the #1788 branch for a log of issues encountered).

I've been refactoring our JS and have managed to strip ckanjs, too, because the only significant element we'd used was the File Upload view (which also now works in IE7).

test.ckan.net has been redeployed on master; I'm browsing the site in IE7 and everything is looking great :-)

To reproduce it, you just have to edit the same dataset in both sites (production and testing). Just after editing the dataset, the search index will get mixed site_ids.

I checked the jetty logs (see attached files) and just after editing a dataset there are two POST requests to update the index. The request logs don't show the requests params so it's hard to tell what the second call does (it probably is the commit):
https://bitbucket.org/okfn/ckan/src/97e1e90d66d7/ckan/lib/search/index.py#cl-144

In any case, it's clear that the problem may be related with the datasets in the two cores sharing the same id. We are currently using the dataset id as uniqueKey in SOLR, i.e in our schema.xml, we are defining:

{{{
&lt;uniqueKey&gt;id&lt;/uniqueKey&gt;
}}}

According to the SOLR docs:
"If a document is added that contains the same value for this field as an existing document, the old document will be deleted."

http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SchemaXml#The_Unique_Key_Field

I would expect the uniqueKey not to be mixed between cores, but it looks like it happens otherwise. Maybe we should generate a solr_id specific to each document for each site, as described here:
http://wiki.apache.org/solr/UniqueKey#UUID_techniques

(Note that apart from the testing/production site use case, at some point sites involved in harvesting could also end up with datasets with the same id.)

Again, I'm not a SOLR expert, so the problem could be a completely different one!

I guess I may need to run this again when the ckanext-ecportal source is finalised, so leaving this ticket open for now.

The tests have uncovered some inconsistencies in the use of SITE_READ between reading/editing a package in the Web interface vs the REST API. Friedrich, do you want to take a look at ckan/tests/functional/test_authz.py:TestSiteRead.test_pkggroupadmin_read for details and have a think about how this should best work. How about making SITE_READ more widespread in the WUI, to protect read/editing/searching things, in addition to the READ and EDIT RoleActions.

Once that is decided, it should be pretty easy to refer to the tests and document SITE_READ.

I had problems pip and svn and the Cygwin window, so reverted to DOS prompt. I still had the Cygwin tools installed though, so next step is to try it without these at all - they are a big overhead.

Also I think we may need to do a bit more to clarify when you just do a good ticket and when one does a CEP (looking at what has occurred already). I think this may be one reason to keep CEPs separate in drafting from trac as will clearly distinguish CEPs from standard tickets.

 * Is this down (all the time)
 * Has this been down recently
 * When was this last modified (not quality per se ...)

This is an area where referring back to the original user stories (if any) around QA is really useful.

I guess my feeling would be some of this should be about providing e.g. helper methods so that theme designers can incorporate things into their design with some work putting this into default CKAN theme.

I'm also happy to leave both TestSiteRead and TestLockedDownUsage as they complement each other nicely actually.

So I think all that remains for this ticket is to add a paragraph to the authz documentation about SITE_READ. Pudo would you mind doing this? It's well worth noting where it applies and where it doesn't.

If we want something more sophisticated, determine an appropriate fallback etc, then I think the API is the way to go. Or we could get CKAN to determine the appropriate language file and include it in the page source...

If you ignore the errors, you find you can't edit the dataset without correcting the validation error, and you often end up guessing, just to get your other changes in. All in all, I think it is better to nudge users, with javascript pop-ups in the form, or quality scores, rather than hard-and-fast validation.

Does this mean like the setup on groups on the datahub (i.e. forward to new dataset but with some things hard-coded, organization/group?)? Or does it mean actual new dataset form on organization page.

These are things needed to really archive the data well, but they have nothing to do with CKAN core ops. Essentially, the archiver is a seperate concern and it need not appear in the CKAN config.

For example need to be clear on the purpose of a user dashboard vs say a publisher dashboard. I image a publisher dashboard would have the stats to datasets belonging to that group (e.g. views, downloads, comments, shares, ratings), issues reported (when we get that extension working), call to action to add a new dataset (that adds it to the group).

User dashboards I'm less clear about. May be we can talk about this on Tues/Wed? Or skype today

I deliberately didn't suggest any detail on the authz front because I know other related changes are afoot so it would be useful for David Raznick to contribute here.

I really like the url ideas - more like github. /&lt;agent&gt; having a list of packages and a search box, plus a link to the latest revisions would be great. /package/&lt;package_name&gt; would usefully redirect to /&lt;agent&gt;/&lt;package_name&gt;. I do think this should be split off into a separate ticket though. What do you think?

Option A: store only mirrors of source files, have file format based plugins for querying files

Option B: store mirrors of source files, have plugin based loading scripts into "common structured format", have single query module.

I would go with option B as it is:

- easier to implement - file format based transformations are simpler than file format based queries
- more transparent data management process
- only one simple query module
(see attached  ckan-srcmirror.png)

The Option B will fit better to the broader data architecture context:

Concerning API I would suggest to try to be compatible with google spreadsheet API:

There are ideas being suggested for replacing bits of front-end, but forms hard to do, and David's new system is a significant offering on top of the CKAN back-end, so it seems crazy to me to abandon it.

forms.rst has been updated by David Raznick in the release_v1.4.1 branch.

i18n.rst - include here the creation of the pot file, deploying a translation, transifex admin

load-testing.rst - I think performance should be mentioned in the glossy guide (some sort of basic metrics of speed profile, to return web pages, run searches and API operations, for 100 or 1000 packages, on a given spec machine) and have it based on a report showing how we measured it. The report would look a bit like this file, and it might do as a stub, but it seems pretty lacking.

distributed.rst - agreed, remove.

design.rst - agreed, delete.

loaders.rst / loader_scripts.rst - yes move to wiki

feeds.rst - this should be split into a tutorial for the wiki and the reference page left in sphinx

importer.rst - this should be moved to ckanext-importer/doc

admin.html - this has already gone in 1.4.1

authorization.rst - This is a bit jumbled. We're talking about changes to the code, so maybe not worth working hard to make this good, so I suggest leaving it, but delete the boring section "Requirements and Use Cases".

deb.rst - this is an administrator task, so should stay why move this to the wiki?

buildbot.rst - ok to stay here?

vm.rst - I assume there's no problem with this

The idea would be to do the following things: 

1. Create a registry mapping format extensions to mime types: RepresentationRegistry.add_format('json', 'application/json')
2. Create a registry of (mime types, entity types) -&gt; converter functions that yield an appropriate representation of the entity. 
3. Hook this into the _finish method of the API controller based on Accept: handling
4. Add support for /api/rest/ENTITY/NAME.{format} and /ENTITY/NAME.{format} to routing, use registry from (1) to rewrite accept headers. 
5. Register converters in load_environment or via IConfigurable plugins
6. Document

What do you think?

For example, to list rights you just loop over obj_classes to call {{{model.Session.query(obj_class).all()}}} and then display the values: {{{type(subj).__name__, subj.name, role, type(obj).__name__, obj.name}}}. 

To change a right you simply call {{{model.add_user_to_role(subj, role, obj)}}} or {{{model.add_authorization_group_to_role(subj, role, obj)}}}.

But of course if there is useful stuff to factor out then be my guest!

e.g. You might make format field simply a drop-down with only some common options: 'CSV, Excel, Zip, Other'. If you go for Other, then a more substantial UI appears, to cover more filetypes, APIs, services and a text box for Other. And if you select 'Zip' then another set of options appears to say what is in the zip. etc.etc.

Another approach would be to have a background process downloading the data file and filling this in for you.

The issue is that Datastore does not exist *just* to provided data views - it also provides a bunch of other stuff like a Data API and, well, a Datastore. I also think there are different audiences. Data view info is about publishers and (viewing) users, while the Data API is for (non-CKAN) devs and CKAN devs and the Datastore sysadmin section is for deployers.

My feeling is therefore keeping things as is but with more stuff in the Data View seciton about it all works:

 * Data viewer: explanation for publisher, links to next 2 sections 
 * Datastore page (as we have it)
  * Includes datastorer 
 * Using Data API page (as we have it)

So main change is a better data viewer page ...
