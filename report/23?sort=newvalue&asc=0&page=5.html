I'm tempted by John's 'permissive' suggestion of ignoring these 'read-only' values, but to avoid confusion we should except with a 400 error if the user has changed these values. 

Read only fields: 'id', 'relationships', 'ratings_average', 'ratings_count', 'ckan_url'

Use cases for changes between GET package, PUT package:
 1. package unchanged - 200 OK
 2. user changes id, ckan_url, relationships, ratings_* expecting that value to change - 400 error.
 3. just license changes (but not license_id) - 400 error
 4. both license and license_id change in step - 200 OK

Does that sound reasonable John and Will?

Further question: which extensions should be installed as standard?  I would argue:

 * ckanext-stats
 * ckanext-googleanalytics
 * ckanext-disqus
 * ckanext-solr (implies installing a running solr, too...)
 * ckanext-follower
 * ckanext-admin

Note that googleanalytics and disqus both require user accounts set up at the corresponding service.  Not sure how we would handle this in the instance setup.

I have tried here to extract what John and Seb might be suggesting is difficult with our current http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control system.

1. (Seb) It seems crazy to change the User-Object-Roles for every single package to 'lockdown' a CKAN instance. Instead of using Roles 'reader' &amp; 'editor' we start using Roles 'logged_in_user' and 'anon_user'. Then, with only changing a couple of lines of the Role-Action table for these Roles, you can give or remove permissions to edit / create packages, groups etc.

2. (John) Actions are being added all the time by migrations and extensions. I'm not sure what the problem is here - can someone explain? The separation of Users and the new Actions by adding the Role 'join' means the migration/extension can add existing Users with the new Actions. For example when we added the 'Group' protection object, logged in users could previously create groups, so it is natural to add this action to the 'editor' role. If you get rid of Roles, as John suggests, then you end up having to add as many Rights objects as users. And you might end up trying to infer new Rights on the basis of old Rights, rather than a role, which would be more natural. (Is the only reason to denormalise the UOR and RA tables the sake of ease of understanding? I would think we can explain the concept better now...!)

3. (John) This Group Hierarchy description sounds a bit like earlier incarnations of the DGU requirements. "or any of his groups group-children (but not user-children)" I'm not sure I understand the user-children bit, and I'm wary of any difficult-to-grasp concept. This modelling seems to take the UserGroup/User hierarchy model and use that as a hard-coded interpretation of the Authorized permission. In contrast, in DGU Evan split the Organisation Hierarchy model from the Authorization model. Each User has explicit permissions for each Organisation he is allowed to add/edit packages for. This helps for these two use cases we have to contend with: when a user is an admin for unrelated branches of the Organisation hierarchy, and when an Organisation is actually in two branches of the Organisation hierarchy. It also seems more generally flexible.

Along the lines of: http://docs.ckan.org/extensions.html#finding-extensions

It wasn't until I wrote this list that I realised just how many extensions there were, and what it said about the CKAN community that there were so many... 

So I think it would be a good sales point.

Tests would be nice, but it currently works, is only for admins and is therefore not as high priority as other other tests, such as front-end js.

Suggest all my work should be moved into the ckanext-qa extension and plugged into the API available there. Shouldnt have developed this in core after all.

The "bad" code was:
  resources.append((res['url'], res['format'], res['description'], res['hash']))
KeyError: 'hash'

This code was adjusted in revision 40c4fe04038d, to default unspecified resource attributes to the empty string. It was changed further in subsequent revisions, to use parameters of the Package.add_resource method to default unspecified values.

However, the API doc doesn't mention the resource hash, although it is required, but I just fixed that in the source (in revision 0f20bfb45d13).

Steps:
1. Create new dataset. Name whatever, resource it a link (I use http://trac.ckan.org/ticket/2734) e.g. http://s031.okserver.org:2375/dataset/format-error-test
2. Once you've *finished* the dataset creation process you are on the main dataset page. Click on the resource you added.
3. Click on "edit"
4. Change resource field to "html," for example and click on "update resource"
5. Error shows, clicking on "update resource" doesn't do anything.

How about I do it and you watch via screen share?

The help text could explain what the response meant but more importantly would show examples of other calls you can make with the IDs returned such that the whole API is discoverable without anyone ever needing to read any docs! It also means the API documentation is more likely to be up to date since it will be obvious to developers when it isn't.

With help=False, the JSON can have all whitespace stripped too for production use.

I also think there should be no distinction between GET and POST so that people can easily link to API calls if they want to.

 * kind: file | api | example | service

 * mimetype-inner: mimetype of innermost object (so for example would be text/csv)

                          <td class="newvalue">We still do need something like this. Right now the rdf generation is a cron job that crawls the API. Really we want two things:

  * only generate RDF for those packages that have changed
  * enable multiple client/worker processes, potentially run
    by third parties, to generate different parts of the RDF
    description.

For example, it is reasonable that we generate the DCat representation ourselves, however the voiD authors (DCat is generic, voiD is about RDF datasets in particular) want to generate the voiD-specific annotations themselves and contribute it back to augment the catalogue.

Another example: group curators may also want to annotate packages in their group with group-specific metadata.

Yet another example: checks on the coherence, availability, quality, openness, etc. of a package should be done from time to time or when a package changes, which can result in further annotations (see the curate tool).

Because of the "third party" aspect we cannot do this with the internal package representation and the rabbit queue. Most likely it is feasible to do this by looking at the revisions in the API to get all changes since the last time a script was run in which case most likely the answer is, yes, there is nothing to do here and the ticket can be closed.

* The source type and label should be part of the plugin, not named in DGU.
* Need warnings if a document changes but its date doesn't -&gt; do we have these?
* I noticed there are some tests in DGU, should these perhaps be in ckanext-harvest?
* If active is False, the job should not be put on the queue
* Log if the wrong type of URL is entered as an error the user can see
* Deny if the source is already registered
* Overwrite all extras, not just merge new ones.
* During the import stage use iswms.py to add an extra during import if it is a WMS so that we can add a link to the WMS later https://gist.github.com/900878
* Can errors/warnings be logged in the import stage? Do all fetched documents get passed to import in one go?
