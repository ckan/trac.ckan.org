this isn't really needed then!  there is no point doing work if we need to do it again editing resources is easy enough now anyway

I suggest we just close this ticket as a won't fix and #2705 as well while we're at it.

I'm also not happy about these being added to the phase 2 milestone when we are at the end of finishing it and these are not bugfixes or critical functionality

                          <td class="newvalue">This relates to #2705. We need to decide what happens when the user clicks on one of the sidebar links.

At the moment they'll get a warning if they've edited the form telling them they'll lose thier changes. Perhaps we should submit the form using ajax, showing a spinner to the user, then send them on to the next resource.

This is the same situation as if we add an "add new resource" button to the listing.

I don't like auto submit as people may think (reasonably) that their changes are discarded.

We could catch all clicks and then ask the user if they've changed something but this feels a little crazy - better than the browser dialog.  hmmm

maybe we should discuss this ticket with the other backlog of undecided/unsure

personally I think we need to review the whole edit/view/delete logic as it feels real poor from my perspective - I need to edit something to delete it - that is a wtf imho

let's work out what we are doing before wasting energy on this

I'm not sure about this if some one is editing a resource moving to edit the dataset seems wrong -  a back to resource makes sense to me but not moving to the edit page

I've done this - it needs a bit of work ie breadcrumb and you won't like what I did with the css classes/js- a better solution is needed but this gives a quick example that we can improve on

can you use links to s031 for stuff like this as it is the testing serve and i can play with the data more - unless the error is specific to demo.ckan.org

-------------

with this issue it is actually wider than you suggest as I cannot edit the group that the dataset is in either.  We need to discuss this one as I don't know the best approach should groups select datasets or datasets groups or both - how do we remove datasets from groups - who can do this etc - maybe next week?

I have disabled the sort order of group datasets in phase 2 as it is totally broken - I'll re-add it in phase 3

Also the comment you made you added bug2 - text covers order by box -PLEASE DO NOT DO THIS - all it does is make the tickets really hard to deal with - if this becomes a habit I will close all such tickets as INVALID as it makes trac unusable for developers - THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT - cheers

@aron,

can you watch for feature creep in tickets and let me know if it happens - thanks

It is much easier to work with tickets that only cover one thing - If something is found then the easiest thing is to add a new ticket.  If you feel it's related to another ticket then you can add that to the new ticket eg related to #1234

If tickets need combining it is easy for us devs to do it.  Basically adding something to a ticket is generally a bad thing.  Sometimes it's fair enough if something is missing for a new feature being reviewed etc - but even then a new ticket is generally not a problem.  Small tickets are nice to work on as we can close them quick etc.  The old [super] style tickets have been banned as they generally lead to owners becoming demotivated and unproductive.

It's always nice if you can find if a ticket already exists but I don't mind you opening a few duplicates if you can't find the ticket - for the demo you can probably just skim the tickets in the milestones as there aren't too many - but as you know I try to review them quite often.

Also please don't reopen really old tickets just add a new one If it's been closed in the last month or so then feel free to re-open if you're sure it's not just waiting for release - you can always check with the last owner of the ticket.

hope that makes sense

I think this is an old dataset it works fine with new ones.  I think this is a corrupt data issue.

also HTML, is fine as a format

please reopen if you can reproduce with a dataset that has been created since the update today

can you try to work out exactly how to cause this problem starting with `add a dataset` and let me know how you break things

tell me all the fields you filled in - also try to get it to happen using as little effort as possible  eg 
add dataset http://s031.okserver.org:2375/dataset/new

title = mooooo

click next:add data

resource = moo
format = csv

click `save &amp; add another`


click on resource just created in sidebar to edit

change format to `HTML,`  

click `Save &amp; add another`


etc


that all works fine for me what am i doing wrong?
thanks

also please try using a non sysadmin account

Steps:
1. Create new dataset. Name whatever, resource it a link (I use http://trac.ckan.org/ticket/2734) e.g. http://s031.okserver.org:2375/dataset/format-error-test
2. Once you've *finished* the dataset creation process you are on the main dataset page. Click on the resource you added.
3. Click on "edit"
4. Change resource field to "html," for example and click on "update resource"
5. Error shows, clicking on "update resource" doesn't do anything.

How about I do it and you watch via screen share?

the initial verdict is that our translation coverage is extremely poor and we need a full template review - maybe there is a jinja2 i18n solution but I think not without `{% trans %}`

Moving to phase 4 - also I'm just holding this ticket and will be allocating to aron's successor

Publishers vs Groups is more complex than I think is appreciated, is it really worth the time and effort just to make everyone using ckan confused?  Anyhow that discussion is not part of this ticket as it is not in-scope

I've added a data summary

The data errors for empty fields are not happening due to our use of repoze.who for logins which is crap and doesn't provide feedback re loggin details so not possible without hacking repoze which i'm not doing.


Could you look at cleaning up the error summary we don't supply a field name (key) as not relevant it would be nice if we could hide the :  also removing the invalid fields message would be good to hide maybe add this as an option to the macro
