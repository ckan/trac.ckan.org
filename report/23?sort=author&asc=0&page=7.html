At the moment we are not adding migrations to remove the harvesting tables. We are designing a harvesting refactor and will write migrations once the refactor is complete so that instances that use harvesting get upgraded, and those that don't get their harvesting tables removed.

Also, see this #1030 for the moving harvesting out of the REST API.

I'm assigning this to you but it isn't a priority yet. We'll put it in a sprint when it is time to do it.

Other ideas:

* The apps will need an image upload
* We might like a voting system for apps and ideas, potentially that could be re-used later. 

Let's discuss the above ideas after the basic functionality is in place.

The help text could explain what the response meant but more importantly would show examples of other calls you can make with the IDs returned such that the whole API is discoverable without anyone ever needing to read any docs! It also means the API documentation is more likely to be up to date since it will be obvious to developers when it isn't.

With help=False, the JSON can have all whitespace stripped too for production use.

I also think there should be no distinction between GET and POST so that people can easily link to API calls if they want to.

David Raznick and I have also agreed that for API 3, each call to the logic layer will return an object (basically a dictionary) rather than using Exceptions. This means the return values from the logic layer can exactly mirror the JSON data strucutres returned via the API. 

The help values can come from the docstrings of the logic layer functions.

The problem in the past was that the link was in the yellow box and there was no explanation as to why you had to login. This time you click from the header bar and there is a clear message saying "Unauthorized to create a group" - exactly as a user would expect. Even if the exact text of the ticket description isn't fully implemented in the current release, the UX isn't broken anymore. Yes, it might be even nicer to have a message warning them in advanced but these improvements will be taken forward in the UX work - maybe there is an even better solution than a message?

Since you are unhappy about closing it I'm marking it as "Duplicate" of #1521. As agreed earlier with the entire team, we'll take this forward as part of the groups refactor.

See #1521 for more information.

As a user I want to view a package at a given revision:

Could you please investigate how doable this would be given the current package read.html page. I expect it could be very easy once the revision API is in place because we could build a c.pkg object from the revision data instead of the model data.

Perhaps another case where we could try introducing the dictization?

                          <td class="newvalue">We spent last week integrating the new harvesting architecture and testing the code but there are still some areas that need looking at

* The source type and label should be part of the plugin, not named in DGU.
* Need warnings if a document changes but its date doesn't -&gt; do we have these?
* I noticed there are some tests in DGU, should these perhaps be in ckanext-harvest?
* If active is False, the job should not be put on the queue
* Log if the wrong type of URL is entered as an error the user can see
* Deny if the source is already registered
* Overwrite all extras, not just merge new ones.
* During the import stage use iswms.py to add an extra during import if it is a WMS so that we can add a link to the WMS later https://gist.github.com/900878
* Can errors/warnings be logged in the import stage? Do all fetched documents get passed to import in one go?
