                          <td class="newvalue">I installed CKAN yesterday afternoon from source, using the instructions at

http://docs.ckan.org/en/ckan-1.7/install-from-source.html

Most things worked pretty smoothly and, luckily, when they didn't I
was lucky enough to have David Raznick on hand to help sort them out.
As a result I've made the following notes on where the doc could be
improved.

For some ghastly reason I am running Linux Mint, which is some variant
of Ubuntu. It's not 10.04, so no package, hence the source install.

Sec 2: Not wanting a mysterious file called 'pyenv' in my home
directory, I created a directory ~/ckan and typed 'virtualenv pyenv'
from there. Everything worked fine. But if I had needed the 'tip' it
would have been a little confusing. It would also be worth reminding
the user that the dubious package is one they've supposedly just
installed, so if that went OK, they won't need to worry about this.

The tip also isn't clear about under what circumstances I'd need to do
the 'easy_install pip' - I didn't need to (is that also only when
python-virtualenv is missing?)

Sec 4: This worked, but the example command for installing a
particular version is confusing. It says it is for 1.5.1, but
replacing '1.5.1' with '1.7' fails because there is a rogue 'c' in the
command.

Probably it would be better to use the latest version (1.7) as the
example anyway. Or is there a way of asking for the latest released
version?

I understand this checks out the whole Git repository with all history
- I can't imagine why I'd need to do this to build a particular
version. But David assures me it's very sensible.

Sec 6: This worked, but it wasn't very clear what the purpose of the
'List existing databases' step was.

Sec 8: So now I had to try to get Solr working using the instructions at

http://docs.ckan.org/en/ckan-1.7/solr-setup.html

This didn't work at all, in ways I can't now remember, to do with
Java. In the end David suggested using Tomcat rather than Jetty (don't
ask me what these do, but they have something to do with getting Solr
to work ...) and this turned out to be much more straightforward to
install and get working, with two caveats (below). David suggested
maybe Tomcat should be the default suggested in this doc.

- One problem with Jetty was to do with using the wrong version of
Java, which seemed to be fixed using "sudo update-alternatives
--config java". It didn't fix Jetty - not sure if it would also have
been needed with Tomcat.
- Soft linking the schema file didn't work - it seems Tomcat doesn't
like soft links. We made a copy.

After this everything worked, and I now have my very own CKAN. Hurrah!

http://docs.ckan.org/en/ckan-1.7/post-installation.html

claim to be for either package or source installations, but only work
as stated if you have done a package installation. E.g. after a source
install, "paster --plugin=ckan user add admin
--config=/etc/ckan/std/std.ini" doesn't work (the ini file is
somewhere completely different), but just typing "paster user add
admin" from the ckan directory is fine.

The instructions should also mention that the virtual environment
should be activated.

1. Did you have anything in mind for improving the "Powered by CKAN" text and icon?  I'll sort out the vertical alignment of the text and icon; and see if Sam has a better icon.  

2. The branded section itself is already customizable by a snippet (https://github.com/okfn/ckan/blob/master/ckan/templates/snippets/data-viewer-embed-branded-link.html).  Is that enough?  Or are you asking for something else?

3. Personally I think the URI should use the resource uuid, and not name.  And from recent discussions on ckan-dev, I think the consensus is the same.  How important is this for you?  Perhaps it's something that could be overriden in the datahub extension.

Resolution:

 - I've decided to keep the behaviour of not parsing UTC offsets because we currently don't store timezone information in the database; and I think that either dropping the tzinfo, or adjusting for it would appear to be "magic behaviour" from the user's perspective.  Also, as this is a helper function, I think it makes sense to keep the behaviour as is, even if it's slightly non-standard.

This fix [1] maintains all the old non-ISO behaviour:

 - not allowing UTC offset to be specified.
 - arbitrary delimiters between date and time values.
 - microsecond precision.

But won't parse "+0100" as microsecond precision.

I tried using a couple of python modules for parsing date strings; but none maintained the same behaviour.

 * Related is a pretty terrible name in the UI - much better to have it called Apps, Ideas etc (perhaps title tag could even give more details e.g. "Apps, Ideas, Visualization and other material related to this dataset") -- btw i thought this was in #2332 but realize it wasn't (apologies for that!)
 * Documentation, documentation, documentation - AFAICT I can't see anything in v1.7 or master docs. I imagine this would be a short section like http://docs.ckan.org/en/ckan-1.7/commenting.html (and probably coming right after that in the ToC) which says
  * What it does
  * How to enable (and perhaps includes a nice-screenshot!)
  * How to customize (e.g. can one customize the list of options of things one can create (e.g. can I set it to just be app and idea or ...)
  * Also liase with Mark W re a blog post about this from the user perspective (a screenshot walkthrough ...)
 * Clearly mark this old extension as deprecated from v1.7 forward: https://github.com/okfn/ckanext-apps (I just met someone last week who was working on integrating this and had no idea it was replaced by something better in v1.7)

If things are hard to find we need to change our relevancy first.  So if you have examples of where you think the scoring is wrong then please make a ticket for that.

Google, I imagine, just has a cutoff of anything under a certain score not being shown.  We could do that as well but it would take some working out what we wanted that score to be.

Full "And" queries also limit any accidental discovery, especially of rare terms.  If you do not get your search exactly correct then you get nothing, which is bad.

Obviously you can still AND things or +things.

The correct solution to this is adding a minimum match parameter which is a middle ground. eg you can say that you want to match over half of the terms.  "thing1 thing2 thing3 thing3"  means you have to match at least 2. There are many options described here. http://wiki.apache.org/solr/DisMaxQParserPlugin.   You can change this in an extension if you want it just requries adding an mm field to the before_search in the Ipackage controller.  I do not personally think we should change it as default.

I am closing it as wont fix as its trivial to change and is a philosophical difference not a technical one.

We really do need to fix this as it is really poor UX. To give, yet another, example:

http://datahub.io/dataset?q=thatcher+wages

This returns 15 datasets yet only one of them has any mention of thatchers (the first one!). (The others are there because they match wages). This isn't what I expect. I expect *only* to see datasets that match *both* terms ...

Google don't OR the results, they have an explicit operator for ORing query terms and default to ensuring that all terms are present (in one form or another) in the documents.  I understand the argument about cut-offs and relevancy scores, but for a large search engine they have the benefit of scale both in resource and documents. I spent 6 months of my life tweaking weightings for n-dimensional vector space search, I don't think it is likely to be a number we can, or will find by accident.

Given that Marcus also got confused by the current behaviour I think we should either:

a) Make it configurable
b) Just change it to what has been asked for

Don't care which.

{{{
curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/3/action/package_search?q=police
}}}

or, for cases where a more complex data_dict is required, the data_dict can be parsed as a json-encoded dict in a single url-parameter called ``data_dict``, ie:

{{{
curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/3/action/package_search?data_dict={'q':'police'}
}}}

As part of this ticket:

 - I noticed that all module-public members of the action modules were being loaded as actions (including functions imported from other modules).  So I've cleared up the  action modules to prevent this.

 - I've cleaned up the action modules to use ``get_or_bust()`` when accessing a passed in data_dict outside before it's been validated by a schema.  This provides better error messages for clients.

 - provided a decorator, ``@side_effect_free``, for users implementing their own actions through the IActions interface to be able to expose their custom/overridden actions as a GET request through the action API.

Another option is to have the data_dict json-encoded in the GET request's body.  This is possible, but

1) Although permissable, it's not, as I understand it, conventional to have a GET request's body form the options of the request.

2) Caching proxies won't inspect the body of the request, only the URL.
