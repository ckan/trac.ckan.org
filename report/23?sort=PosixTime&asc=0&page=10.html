Current thinking is that option 4 is a default (as per ckanext-rdf) rdf output that is generated not in code (as currently) but using a genshi xml template to read the package into an RDF format (as if it were HTML). This would then be overrideable so that for ecportal where the format of the RDF is different (change of vocabs etc) we can just point the config to a new template.

Pros:

  Easy to implement 

  Easy to use 

  Not hard-coded as currently 

  Fast execution


Cons:

  Requires knowledge of required RDF output if default is not useful
  RDF and not any of the other formats yet. 
  Only works with package/resource/tags unless more work is done

                          <td class="newvalue">Current thinking is that option 4 is a default (as per ckanext-rdf) rdf output that is generated not in code (as currently) but using a genshi xml template to read the package into an RDF format (as if it were HTML).  This would then be overrideable so that for ecportal where the format of the RDF is different (change of vocabs etc) we can just point the config to a new template.

Pros:
  Easy to implement
  Easy to use
  Not hard-coded as currently
  Fast execution

Cons:
   Requires knowledge of required RDF output if default is not useful
   RDF and not any of the other formats yet.
   Only works with package/resource/tags unless more work is done

n3 sounds useful, but given we could allow people to specify an RDF template we may as well do that as well as it would then suffice for ecportal who appear to want rdf as well.

Will check out json-ld as an option too.

Furthermore, key dev info like how to setup and do extensions *is* already in the main docs (see http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/writing-extensions.html) and has been for 6m+. I've created #2226 for more work on docs and you may wish to comment there.

3) urls should be consistent so we should use id not name for datasets etc

Rather than update ckanext-apps I suggest we do a rewrite. I've created a detailed super ticket at #2204 and assigned to you Adria for review and thoughts. (While I understand #2204 may involve more work which we maybe cannot do before relaunch I'd still recommend starting on that rather than spending time upgrading this extension -- if we have to disable it for relaunch I don't think that is a big deal ...)

 * Get a Dataset / Resource etc as DCAT RDF (I'd suggest we *just* supply something simple like n3 or even json-ld (see below))
 * (Possibly not even essential) Consuming Dataset info in that format

And even more radical solution would be to simply use json-ld: http://json-ld.org/ which would then just involve minors mods to our json output.

Having this in core (with option to enable?) would be a nice 80/20 (it was this feature that everyone asked for at the LOD meetup -- no-one mentioned SPARQL).

&gt; Believe most of these are resolved by https://github.com/okfn/ckan/commit/27f4fc776b9199621d259749cf20787328df101f
&gt; 
&gt; @zephod: could you check again and see if anything remains?

I noticed that Thedatahub with latest code is still messed up..I was working with absolute paths in my environment without the h.url_for_static() to include the html5shiv.js script so I missed a problem, which can be fixed with my new [pull request #4](https://github.com/okfn/ckan/pull/4).

I'm aware of only one problem left: when you hit the "Upload a File" button inside the Dataset Edit/Resources tab nothing happens in IE &lt; 9.
This is related to those IE versions not being able to dynamically insert HTML 5 tags, which breaks some jquery-tmpl (actually JQuery) operation (if you debug the code everything works in jquery-tmpl until one of the latest operation involving JQuery returns null instead of the expected object).
I was able to fix the issue in my environment by adding the following conditional comment:
{{{
 &lt;/script&gt;
 &lt;!--[if lt IE 9]&gt;
 &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="/scripts/jquery.html5.preie9fix.js"&gt;
 &lt;/script&gt;
 &lt;![endif]--&gt;
}}}
where the jquery.html5.preie9fix.js is simply the [gist](https://gist.github.com/887560) published by Akkuma in a [jquery-tmpl issue (#36)](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-tmpl/issues/36#issuecomment-918495).

This script patches JQuery on the fly on IE &lt; 9 to rework in memory html 5 blocks handled by JQuery, so that it doesn't break.

And this fixes the "Upload a File" button on IE.
I didn't commit/pull this specific fix for the following reasons:
* the script embeds innerShiv, which is a previous incarnation of html5shiv (now included in CKAN). It doesn't sound fine to include 2 pieces of code with similar effect, but I couldn't reproduce the fix with html5shiv!
* in my environment I have included this fix sitewide even if I didn't spot other problematic features..I don't know if it would be better to include it only on the dataset edit page in the official CKAN code.

Summary: I leave to you guys the choice on how to deal with this problem.

I had to make a modification to the backend: When saving a resource, you have to submit the complete set of extras. Unsubmitted extras are assumed to be deleted. (This matches the behaviour of the package form).

I looked at removing the openid middleware, but we use it for logging out users, whether they logged in or not - it looks like friendly form plugin is not as good as the openid one in this respect! We could hack the logout function into the friendly form to sort this out, but not sure the effort is worth it at the moment.

3. There are thousands. We just show the most popular/relevant tags for your search. This could break out into another ticket though - eg. autocompleting tag input on the page?
4. Can't remember what this is...
5. I did this a while ago and popular opinion was that it should change back. This gives us room for expanded options like on thedatahub's live search page right now, and matches the layout of the Groups view page.
6. They should maybe be ordered by relevance, which includes popularity in some metric? This should be broken into a seperate ticket if you want it to go ahead and given to a Solr expert.
