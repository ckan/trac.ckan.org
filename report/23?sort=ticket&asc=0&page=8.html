One page where the portal admin can choose and/or change the:

3. About page text
4. Featured dataset &amp; text on homepage ?

please do not try to change the meaning of tickets/add features or they will just get closed as won't fix.

featured datasets is nothing whatsoever to do with this ticket so adding it to the ticket just causes me to get upset / demotivated etc.  please do not do this.  It ruins my day.

Also comments like see sams design is of no value without a url in fact it has negative value.

:(

I have changed the priority of this ticket to account for this but next time i'll just close it.

Issue was that our auto-completion depended on structure of the HTML which changes with bootstrapification.

BTW: have deployed this via copy and paste on datahub so i can use it. Will want to revert this when you do a deploy.

@Ross: I note that the same bug probably affects organization auto-complete.

                          <td class="newvalue">Many strings have been fixed (and committed on master). Still to go:

When uploading a file:

- The "Browse..." button. This comes from the user's browser?

- Hangs when I try to upload a file, so the rest of this UI is unchecked.

The licenses on the dataset add, edit and view pages, "License Not Specified" etc.

Dataset state on dataset view page, e.g. "active".

When adding or editing resources:

- The resource types (Data File, etc.) The strings seem to come from resource.resource_type.

- "You can use Markdown formatting here", "Should a DataStore table and Data API be enabled for this resource?", "Dates are in ISO Format — eg. 2012-12-25 or 2010-05-31T14:30". I can't get strings with hyperlinks in them to translate here.

Dataset view page:

- License not specified.

Dataset search page:

- "Tags", "Res_format" and "Groups" in the sidebar. Leaving because this code has been refactored on feature-1821-multilingual-extension. Fix after that branch has been merged.

Dataset view page:

- The resource types, e.g. "plain text".
- The field names under additional information: cache_last_updated etc.

Dataset history view: timestamps not localised.

Login page:

- "Login failed. Bad username or password. (Or if using OpenID, it hasn't been associated with a user account.)" This string is marked for translation but I can't seem to get translations to work for flash messages. Also "Sean Hammond is now logged in" flash message.

Register page:

- "Missing value" in error message when you try to register and don't give an email. The string seems to come from formencode. stdtrans() not working?

User view page:

- Activity streams strings. Activity streams genshi function needs a little refactoring to be i18n-friendly.

Users page:
- "less than 1 month". This string comes from Pylons' time_ago_in_words() function which doesn't appear to support i18n.

New auth group (and edit auth group) page:

- "Unique identifier for group. 2+ chars, lowercase, using only 'a-z0-9' and '-_'". This string is marked for translation but for some reason it isn't working.

- "Name: Please enter a value" (in an error msg)

- "User name". The string comes from class FormBuilder?

Also, need to check that all tooltips are translated!

The idea of this ticket is to separate TDH into an extension rather than it being incorporated into core.  This should help TDH by making it possible to push fixes without needing to do a new release of core.  It should also help make core more stable and as slim line as possible.  New features can be tested in TDH and then if they have a wider appeal they can be merged into core.

There is a strong desire for this within the dev team.

Thanks, I think there is overlap and I'm happy to leave that bit of work to you (or future ticket owner) I was just adding some brief notes to this ticket on some of the outcomes I'd like to see and hence why I'd be happy to simplify the icons.

Good question. WIll add to description.

&gt; &gt;  New datasets can be created from the organization form, in which case the organization will be set in the dataset form dropdown (with privacy set to private - see below)
&gt; Does this mean like the setup on groups on the datahub (i.e. forward to new dataset but with some things hard-coded, organization/group?)? Or does it mean actual new dataset form on organization page.

The former, although currently we will have a slightly different form in the organizations extension, until such a time as we're ready to replace the existing one.  Tried merging the two forms but it ended up with such a mess of logic that it was unmanageable.

we have fanstatic integration in ckan.demo work

tdh is it's own extension

h.snippet is in 1.7

ITemplateHelpers in 1.7

This allows most of the issues resolved.  Full removal of the IGenshiStream filter still neads some form of in template hooks but this is being looked at as a possiblity in ckan demo and can be considered out of scope for this ticket

US1 As a Site Admin / Visitor (?) I want to see how often a page has been viewed (every page) and how often resources have been downloaded.
US1a Next to a resource or a dataset see how often it has been downloaded / viewed
US1b I want to see datasets or resources ranked by most downloaded or viewed
US1c See a trend graph for a dataset (and resources)
Adminstrative Dashboard (?)
    * I want to see the traffic breakdown by country to my site ...
    * Ditto for browser type, language, etc etc
    * I want to see it graphed over time ...
== Implementation Details ==
1. How do we store this data in CKAN?
2. How do we track (and store)?
3. How do we display
* Config option ckan.status.enabled = False (by default)
=== Storing Data ===
How does ckanext-googleanalytics do this? Current table:
package_id | count_recent | count_total
Move to a new stats_summary table
id | item_id | object_type | stats_type (total, month_yyyy_mm, ...) | value
Do we store this data into the search (solr) so we can search by it?
=== Displaying Data ===
 * Helper functions / dictize:
  * Helper function: h.stats_get(object_type, id, stats_type)
   * h.stats_top_ranked(object_type, number) -&gt; returns object_dicts or just labels or ...
  * Change to dictize
 * Location in the default theme (do we show for example in search results too!)
 * Support for ranking by most popular in search?
=== Tracking Data ===
* Our own solution (just write to site_tracking)
* Google analytics (plus extension for retrieving data) &lt;- would need a refactor
* Piwiki
==== Own Solution ====
site_tracking table
id | url | timestamp | action (page_view, resource_download) |
 * Make javascript to make request to ckan to store clicks and page views.
 * Add middleware so these requests do not go through pylons and just store data quickly.

* unique total views

* total unique daily views - higher numbers and feels more right - easier to calculate if original data is lost/or archived

for now will collect all and then decide which to use for display as gives us flexibility if needed



display
-------

why is group listing of datasets inconsistent with main search (TDH at least)?
should we make these consistent?

group listing allows downloading of resource without tracking (this should be fixed)

if we make listings uniform do we want the download links or not?

I don't like the term download when it is just a link (maybe that's just me - what would be better?)

It's 80% of the way there; some form CSS needs overriding because Bootstrap tends to make things very large so they spill over. But on the whole the markup is in a steady state, which is what we need.

1) want to cache static files long term - need to add a ?ver=xxx to allow changes - this will need a change to all templates etc - could be seen as a good thing

2) we can only purge specific pages not whole cache so we need to know all the urls which want to be invalidated - including language variants

3) urls should be consistent so we should use id not name for datasets etc

4) for now we can just use short expiry times as this prevents some of these problems

Pros:
  Easy to implement
  Easy to use
  Not hard-coded as currently
  Fast execution

Cons:
   Requires knowledge of required RDF output if default is not useful
   RDF and not any of the other formats yet.
   Only works with package/resource/tags unless more work is done

Cons:

  Requires knowledge of required RDF output if default is not useful
  RDF and not any of the other formats yet.
