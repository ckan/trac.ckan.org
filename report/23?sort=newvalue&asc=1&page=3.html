Actually I see you also want some text changes

please don't add unrelated discussions to tickets as it causes noise is disruptive and I just end up closing tickets as won't fix etc.

I have updated the text as it was assigned to me and so i am still keeping this closed as I did as requested. Can you an ira sort this out between yourselves and create a new ticket when you have agreement

Thanks

the validation error seems correct to use 200

for the created the 303 seems ok but i'd just use pylons redirect myself

Also did aron say we want this as a javascript free add item form

This is an issue with the related items schema - I'm not quite sure what all the rules should be 

eg does visulisation need image url? or is normal url ok?

Could you review the schema and ensure that we require/don't require the correct items.  If you provide the rules I can help do the schema if you want but I don't know them

cheers

can you use links to s031 for stuff like this as it is the testing serve and i can play with the data more - unless the error is specific to demo.ckan.org

-------------

with this issue it is actually wider than you suggest as I cannot edit the group that the dataset is in either.  We need to discuss this one as I don't know the best approach should groups select datasets or datasets groups or both - how do we remove datasets from groups - who can do this etc - maybe next week?

please do not try to change the meaning of tickets/add features or they will just get closed as won't fix.

featured datasets is nothing whatsoever to do with this ticket so adding it to the ticket just causes me to get upset / demotivated etc.  please do not do this.  It ruins my day.

Also comments like see sams design is of no value without a url in fact it has negative value.

:(

I have changed the priority of this ticket to account for this but next time i'll just close it.

                          <td class="newvalue">@thejimmyg: It is neat simple solution.

You have suggested a proxy API:

''There will be a new API at ``/api/spreadsheet?callback=jsonpcallback&amp;url=``
''

There are two options:

1. Have public ckan data proxy as stand-alone service: I get package resource URL from CKAN and pass it to proxy

2. Have ckan data API (as ticket title suggests): If I am talking to CKAN, I am getting data from CKAN, I should not care about proxy or anything behind nor I should care about original data source - I care about resource data in a format that I can process (CSV/JSON).

For CKAN data API I would suggest something like:


{{{
/api/resource_data/RESOURCE_ID?...

}}}

or more human readable:


{{{
/api/resource_data/PACKAGE_NAME/RESOURCE_NUMBER?...

}}}

This will allow others to get only CKAN resources. Moreover, allowing to get only resource data (not any URL data) would allow us to pre-process resources in the future.

First version/implementation: pass each requested resource URL to your proxy service (external, not CKAN related), which determines file by file extension in URL, fail on unknown file or unprocessable file.

/api/resource_data/PACKAGE/RESOURCE?output=jsonp&amp;sheet=1...

would be redirected to (for example):

http://1.latest.jsonpdataproxy.appspot.com/?url=RESOURCE["URL"]&amp;sheet=1...


Second version/implementation: Determine file type in advance and pass to appropriate conversion service when requested

If you upload document on scribd or slideshare it gets processed in the background. This can be done in CKAN after any resource change. We do not need to download the file at the moment, however what can be done is:

1. try a converter by URL file extension
2. try a converter by MIME type (content-type header)
3. brute-force try all converters

No need to store copies of files, just store determined file type somewhere in the resource record (as mime type).

Also, it would be nice if any data conversion service would provide output in both - JSON/CSV. Therefore we would be able to have "Download CSV" link directly in CKAN web page for browsing users:

/api/resource_data/PACKAGE/RESOURCE?output=csv...

I added this post discussion about attribution. Sam says that if we actually use the app itself (currently we're using the maps from it - but primarily by taking screenshots instead of actually integrating) then the attribution would automatically show.

In terms of ticket creating, I added this so people could see it and have a think about whether it's phase 3 or phase 4 (&amp; move where necc) &amp; whether you wanted more detail from me etc or whether it needed to be a more generic kind of ticket (i.e. 'need some low cost / low maintenance way to create backgrounds for demos').

In future, shall I email instead? Call on skype? IRC? before any tickets are created?

                          <td class="newvalue">A general comment: I wonder if we can pull the *core* part of that extension into core and strip out any external dependencies like rdflib. Specifically the 80% use of this extension is the DCAT read/write:

 * Get a Dataset / Resource etc as DCAT RDF (I'd suggest we *just* supply something simple like n3 or even json-ld (see below))
 * (Possibly not even essential) Consuming Dataset info in that format

And even more radical solution would be to simply use json-ld: http://json-ld.org/ which would then just involve minors mods to our json output.

Having this in core (with option to enable?) would be a nice 80/20 (it was this feature that everyone asked for at the LOD meetup -- no-one mentioned SPARQL).

By thinking of it this way in the first instance, we effectively get a read-only copy of other data in CKAN but one which will be kept up to date.

Marking as duplicate. Discussion can now carry on via #987 Common harvesting framework.

For example, this simplifies the use of quotes in identifying tags in internal markdown links:

{{{
tag:"multiple word tag name"
}}}

A possible solution is to allowing escaping, such as:

{{{
tag:"something about \"Ian\""
}}}

But I think the compromise is a better solution than allowing the escaping as it's simpler, and this may crop up elsewhere.

n3 sounds useful, but given we could allow people to specify an RDF template we may as well do that as well as it would then suffice for ecportal who appear to want rdf as well.

Will check out json-ld as an option too.

The fix is simple - commit: 17f33031f5e348e623146601f830b8c67462fe00

But more work will be required to relax this restriction.
