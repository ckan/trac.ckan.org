1. clicking on a tag in 'top tags' takes you to old unstyled page, e.g. http://s031.okserver.org:2375/en/tag/economics. Should take you to search faceted by that tag.
2. I'd love to be able to link directly to e.g. the 'top tags' view - any way to do this?
3. Is there any way to rate datasets at the moment? If not, can we hide that option for now?
4. On 'Revisions to Datasets per week' can we rename this 'Dataset revisions per week' and can we change the orange icon/index in the table to 'all dataset revisions' instead of referencing 'packages'

 1. Clicking a tag now takes you to the search page
 2. When clicking the tabs the location now updates so you can bookmark pages.
 3. Not sure how datasets are rated.
 4. Text changes made.

I'd suggest we add a generic "failed to login, invalid fields" in the error_summary block. Then more specific "this field is required" when a required field is left empty.

I'm going to leave this open for the moment but not make the requested change as I need to think of the best way forward.  The flash message error is quite hard coded into the logic and I need to think of a nice solution.

new templates want to be in templates/... the old templates live in templates_legacy if you need to copy them across that's fine

@ross, templates_legacy are there for ckan users who have their own templates as we are completely rewriting all the existing templates

there is a lovely .ini setting to switch between the new and legacy modes

Just wondering about the use of the c.form variable to insert the form into the page. I know we do this with the dataset and groups to support legacy templates, do we need to do this going forward? I'd rather each action just rendered one template and leaves it up to that to render the rest.

Toby, there's a couple of TODO statements in the code where the breadcrumbs need fixing. I think the templates just need access to the package dict.

https://github.com/okfn/ckan/blob/feature-2375-demo-theme/ckan/templates/related/pages/form_page.html#L6
https://github.com/okfn/ckan/blob/feature-2375-demo-theme/ckan/templates/related/edit.html#L5

Also if you generate an error message on one of the forms (leave the title blank) the error string comes out wrapped in quotes. eg. u'title is missing'

Also might be of interest, I've converted the templates to use Jinja, and this is a good example of the conversion.

this is as good a place as anywhere to answer your question about the c.form thing.

a) some of this we are sort of stuck with.  datasets for example can be of different types and have different forms for different datasets. so they need to be rendered separately.  I have no idea why or how much this is used but it exists as an option to complicate everything, not much we can do about it.

b) I think trying to do pages as a single rendering is not going to be easy because of the way ckan has been created maybe we can change this over time.  One major issue for me is that ckan does lots of crazy stuff for some reasons but these reasons are not apparent from the code.  Maybe there is some documentation somewhere but I'm not convinced.

anyhow we should maybe close this ticket now.  You've added some stuff in the comment for me to do maybe that should be added as a new ticket?

this is now in a snippet (jinja2 allows the selected="selected" more easily) needs some work still eg translation stuff and also maybe completely rewrite the snippet at some point.

Anyhow the functionality is there.  I added the button for no javascript working.

I'm assigning to you for beautification etc

With the `order button` this is for none javascript users i'm not sure the magnifying glass looks like the thing to press to reorder the results.  I'd hide it when javascript enabled.  Do what you will

Toby, can you pull in the top 10 tags, as well as n of the most "popular" datasets and n of the most recent datasets. Actually just providing the functionality as helpers would be great.

Do we actually have "featured" datasets implemented at the moment?

Not sure what we're going to use for the box on the top left when on a new base CKAN instance.

tags what functionality do we want for this?  I can just reuse the facet_list snippet but then we have all sorts of interactivity.  Do we want this more a static list of tags (linked to somewhere but no add remove stuff)? seems more sensible I think

Brief synopsis of changes:

 - altered return type of the action: from Resource domain objects to dictized resources.  This is required if this action is to be made accessible through the action api as the domain object is not json-serializable.  The 'old' return type is still available by passing in a flag in the context.  In fact, this is required as the search layer uses this action, and deals with the domain objects directly.

 - decided that escaping the ':' (as described in above comments) wasn't necessary as resource fields shouldn't have ':' characters in them anyway.

 - improved action's docstring

 - 'fields' parameter has been deprecated ( see #2603 ).  Use of it by the search layer has been removed in favour of the new 'query' parameter.  But it still works, and correctly maintains backward compatibility.

It would be nice to get this fixed and I'm loathed to suggest adding a version 4 hack.
If we make this change it will break things for existing users.  This behaviour has existed since the action api was added as far as I'm aware

So should we
a) leave it forever and document
b) break things and fix it - when 1.7.1 or 1.8?

the reason for this is that controller/package.py renders the form `package/new_package_form.html` as part of it's work and then makes this available a `c.form` to the template.  I'm not sure I like this as an approach but it is how it is currently done.  If you split your form into a new template `package/new_package_form.html` then you get all the errors etc.

I think for now we should do this and then look at if doing it all in one template pass might be more sensible.

reassign to me if you want me to do this else I'll leave it with you
