"Groups allow you to group together datasets under a organisation (for example, the Department of Health) or topic (e.g. Transport, Health) so make it easier for users to browse datasets by theme.

Groups also enable you to assign roles and authorisation to members of the group - i.e. individuals can be given the right to publish datasets from a particular organisation."

But even that could be clearer. 

Mark's text could be misleading since we haven't currently implemented private datasets or the right auth settings.

Re. nested transactions.  I am getting repeated non-deterministic test failures against sqlite (and indeed postgres, but these failures appear more frequent against sqlite).  One of them I seemed to be able to get rid of by eliminating the savepoint as per your first point.  However, it appears that sqlite [http://www.sqlite.org/lang_savepoint.html does] support savepoints; to demonstrate it, the following test code appears to work in the latest sqlalchemy:

{{{
#!python
from sqlalchemy import *
from sqlalchemy.orm import *

db = create_engine('sqlite:///')

metadata = MetaData(db)

users = Table('users', metadata,
    Column('user_id', Integer, primary_key=True),
    Column('name', String(40)),)
users.create()

class User(object):
    pass

usermapper = mapper(User, users)

Session = sessionmaker()
session = Session()

fred = User()
fred.name = "Fred"

sue = User()
sue.name = "Sue"

amy = User()
amy.name = "Amy"

session.add(fred)
session.add(amy)
session.begin_nested()
session.add(sue)
session.rollback()
session.commit()
assert session.query(User).count() == 2
print "OK"

}}}

So, while I agree they're not needed, I'm not sure they're a problem.  What do you think?  Also, have you seen non-deterministic test errors like this?

Work that remains:

 * Add download click tracking to individual download links (currently we just record page views for packages, not downloads)
 * Somehow cache the download stats against each package (the Google API is very slow); package reddis or sqlite or similar as a local storage for the extension
 * Expose download information in the relevant places in the UI (all users? package owners? where?)

This is about 2 days' work.  Unlikely to get it done in this sprint.

 * We are parking this ticket until dictization is complete
 * We would prefer to see roles as asserted globally by default, with packages just storing exceptions.  E.g. If I am a "reader" globally, then I have "read-package" permission on all packages new and existing, unless otherwise asserted locally on a package.
 * Also w.r.t. algorithm above, consider repoze.what's model; "possible" is analagous to "has_permission".  See http://what.repoze.org/docs/1.0/Manual/Predicates/Builtin.html

I would be very happy to write up a full, detailed proposal for the system before we implement anything, if only as a proper straw man to have debates around.

Further question: which extensions should be installed as standard?  I would argue:

 * ckanext-stats
 * ckanext-googleanalytics
 * ckanext-disqus
 * ckanext-solr (implies installing a running solr, too...)
 * ckanext-follower
 * ckanext-admin

Note that googleanalytics and disqus both require user accounts set up at the corresponding service.  Not sure how we would handle this in the instance setup.

The one thing that something like this could be useful is, rather than showing someone how to use the site, showing them what the site is capable of so they can assess whether it meets their needs/is something they're interested in. However, we already have a good guided tour of this type on ckan.org/features, those pages are really pretty good.

Ignore my link above to a branch on my ckan fork. Now that I have permissions I'm pushing my branches to the okfn ckan repo on github. My super branch for the activity streams feature is '''feature-1515-activity-streams''' on the okfn ckan repo on github. This page comparing my branch to master is particularly useful:

https://github.com/okfn/ckan/compare/master...feature-1515-activity-streams

(click on the Files Changed tab)

For reviewing this ticket, the relevant changes to review are:

 * ckan/lib/activity.py, all of it
 * ckan/model/activity.py, all of it
 * My changes to ckan/model/meta.py
 * My changes to ckan/model/package.py
 * My changes to ckan/model/resource.py
 * ckan/tests/models/test_activity.py, all of it

The other changes on my branch are for other activity streams tickets that follow this one. The super ticket #1515 has an overview of it all.

https://github.com/seanh/ckan/compare/feature-1413-ask-users-to-add-email-address

I used flash_notice() to ask the user to add an email whenever they visit their account page, if they don't have one already. This means they'll see the notice when they login, because after login they are redirected to their account page. Issues:

Is it okay to approximate 'once they log in' as 'whenever they visit their account page' like this?

Do I need to do something to support i18n for the string I added? I looked at users of flash_*() elsewhere and they seemed to be hardcoding the strings in English.

  Perhaps it could be done when they come back to the site at intervals (e.g. daily)?

As discussed on IRC I've moved the notice from the user account page to the front page, in the hopes that people will see it often enough even if they are always logged in via a cookie. As discussed on IRC, we could make the notice appear on every page but no more than once per day, but that would be more complicated to implement and more likely to break.

  Yes your strings should be internationalised because they are user visible.

Done.

  You're right that these other strings should be internationalised. I've created a 
  separate ticket for this: #1491

Also done! :)

                          <td class="newvalue">Many strings have been fixed (and committed on master). Still to go:

When uploading a file:

- The "Browse..." button. This comes from the user's browser?

- Hangs when I try to upload a file, so the rest of this UI is unchecked.

The licenses on the dataset add, edit and view pages, "License Not Specified" etc.

Dataset state on dataset view page, e.g. "active".

When adding or editing resources:

- The resource types (Data File, etc.) The strings seem to come from resource.resource_type.

- "You can use Markdown formatting here", "Should a DataStore table and Data API be enabled for this resource?", "Dates are in ISO Format — eg. 2012-12-25 or 2010-05-31T14:30". I can't get strings with hyperlinks in them to translate here.

Dataset view page:

- License not specified.

Dataset search page:

- "Tags", "Res_format" and "Groups" in the sidebar. Leaving because this code has been refactored on feature-1821-multilingual-extension. Fix after that branch has been merged.

Dataset view page:

- The resource types, e.g. "plain text".
- The field names under additional information: cache_last_updated etc.

Dataset history view: timestamps not localised.

Login page:

- "Login failed. Bad username or password. (Or if using OpenID, it hasn't been associated with a user account.)" This string is marked for translation but I can't seem to get translations to work for flash messages. Also "Sean Hammond is now logged in" flash message.

Register page:

- "Missing value" in error message when you try to register and don't give an email. The string seems to come from formencode. stdtrans() not working?

User view page:

- Activity streams strings. Activity streams genshi function needs a little refactoring to be i18n-friendly.

Users page:
- "less than 1 month". This string comes from Pylons' time_ago_in_words() function which doesn't appear to support i18n.

New auth group (and edit auth group) page:

- "Unique identifier for group. 2+ chars, lowercase, using only 'a-z0-9' and '-_'". This string is marked for translation but for some reason it isn't working.

- "Name: Please enter a value" (in an error msg)

- "User name". The string comes from class FormBuilder?

Also, need to check that all tooltips are translated!
