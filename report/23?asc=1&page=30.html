Running locally on an old XP machine, performance seems fine - no noticeable issues.

I installed most things into a pyenv using pip. pyutilib, psycopg2 and lxml were slightly problematic, but I have workarounds.

I had problems pip and svn and the Cygwin window, so reverted to DOS prompt. I still had the Cygwin tools installed though, so next step is to try it without these at all - they are a big overhead.

* Added example Apache &amp; modwsgi deployment.
* Documented extensively at: http://wiki.ckan.org/CKAN_install_on_Windows
* Have not tried SOLR on Windows - I'm not convinced this is high priority, and normal install should be fine as it is so separate from CKAN.

Rather than update ckanext-apps I suggest we do a rewrite. I've created a detailed super ticket at #2204 and assigned to you Adria for review and thoughts. (While I understand #2204 may involve more work which we maybe cannot do before relaunch I'd still recommend starting on that rather than spending time upgrading this extension -- if we have to disable it for relaunch I don't think that is a big deal ...)

I looked at removing the openid middleware, but we use it for logging out users, whether they logged in or not - it looks like friendly form plugin is not as good as the openid one in this respect! We could hack the logout function into the friendly form to sort this out, but not sure the effort is worth it at the moment.

Pros:
  Easy to implement

  Fast execution

Cons:
   Requires knowledge of required RDF output if default is not useful

As far as other uses like showing popular resources etc then we need to decide where the data will live - on the resource or separate.

US1 As a Site Admin / Visitor (?) I want to see how often a page has been viewed (every page) and how often resources have been downloaded.
US1a Next to a resource or a dataset see how often it has been downloaded / viewed
US1b I want to see datasets or resources ranked by most downloaded or viewed
US1c See a trend graph for a dataset (and resources)
Adminstrative Dashboard (?)
    * I want to see the traffic breakdown by country to my site ...
    * Ditto for browser type, language, etc etc
    * I want to see it graphed over time ...
== Implementation Details ==
1. How do we store this data in CKAN?
2. How do we track (and store)?
3. How do we display
* Config option ckan.status.enabled = False (by default)
=== Storing Data ===
How does ckanext-googleanalytics do this? Current table:
package_id | count_recent | count_total
Move to a new stats_summary table
id | item_id | object_type | stats_type (total, month_yyyy_mm, ...) | value
Do we store this data into the search (solr) so we can search by it?
=== Displaying Data ===
 * Helper functions / dictize:
  * Helper function: h.stats_get(object_type, id, stats_type)
   * h.stats_top_ranked(object_type, number) -&gt; returns object_dicts or just labels or ...
  * Change to dictize
 * Location in the default theme (do we show for example in search results too!)
 * Support for ranking by most popular in search?
=== Tracking Data ===
* Our own solution (just write to site_tracking)
* Google analytics (plus extension for retrieving data) &lt;- would need a refactor
* Piwiki
==== Own Solution ====
site_tracking table
id | url | timestamp | action (page_view, resource_download) |
 * Make javascript to make request to ckan to store clicks and page views.
 * Add middleware so these requests do not go through pylons and just store data quickly.

for now will collect all and then decide which to use for display as gives us flexibility if needed



display
-------

why is group listing of datasets inconsistent with main search (TDH at least)?
should we make these consistent?

group listing allows downloading of resource without tracking (this should be fixed)

if we make listings uniform do we want the download links or not?

I don't like the term download when it is just a link (maybe that's just me - what would be better?)

we have fanstatic integration in ckan.demo work

tdh is it's own extension

h.snippet is in 1.7

ITemplateHelpers in 1.7

This allows most of the issues resolved.  Full removal of the IGenshiStream filter still neads some form of in template hooks but this is being looked at as a possiblity in ckan demo and can be considered out of scope for this ticket

                          <td class="newvalue">&gt; What about ownership by users?

Good question. WIll add to description.

&gt; &gt;  New datasets can be created from the organization form, in which case the organization will be set in the dataset form dropdown (with privacy set to private - see below)
&gt; Does this mean like the setup on groups on the datahub (i.e. forward to new dataset but with some things hard-coded, organization/group?)? Or does it mean actual new dataset form on organization page.

The former, although currently we will have a slightly different form in the organizations extension, until such a time as we're ready to replace the existing one.  Tried merging the two forms but it ended up with such a mess of logic that it was unmanageable.

The idea of this ticket is to separate TDH into an extension rather than it being incorporated into core.  This should help TDH by making it possible to push fixes without needing to do a new release of core.  It should also help make core more stable and as slim line as possible.  New features can be tested in TDH and then if they have a wider appeal they can be merged into core.

There is a strong desire for this within the dev team.

Thanks, I think there is overlap and I'm happy to leave that bit of work to you (or future ticket owner) I was just adding some brief notes to this ticket on some of the outcomes I'd like to see and hence why I'd be happy to simplify the icons.
