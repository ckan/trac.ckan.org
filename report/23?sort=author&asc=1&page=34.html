* Many of the departments are blank

Pawel is not available to work on these anyway at the moment, so let's pick them up as part of the disintegration work to migrate to CKAN. Marking the main ticket as "worksforme" since it does now.

a) The site should be self explanatory and if it is not this is a failure of design

b) a cookie would be needed to prevent these happening all the time - cookies are bad as they interfere with caching proxies.

c) I find stuff like this patronising/annoying for the user

d) They are a maintenance burden for ckan as we do not have a single instance

Therefore I'd suggest closing this as a won't fix - I agree this is just a personal view point and therefore am not going to actually close the ticket but just record my opinion.

h.url_for_static() added for none language based urls (css, js)

Base templates updated.

IMPORTANT: pylons.url() removed from ckan.lib.base.render() as this allowed the language functionality to be ignored. Broken templates should use h.url() instead of url().

3) urls should be consistent so we should use id not name for datasets etc

US1 As a Site Admin / Visitor (?) I want to see how often a page has been viewed (every page) and how often resources have been downloaded.
US1a Next to a resource or a dataset see how often it has been downloaded / viewed
US1b I want to see datasets or resources ranked by most downloaded or viewed
US1c See a trend graph for a dataset (and resources)
Adminstrative Dashboard (?)
    * I want to see the traffic breakdown by country to my site ...
    * Ditto for browser type, language, etc etc
    * I want to see it graphed over time ...
== Implementation Details ==
1. How do we store this data in CKAN?
2. How do we track (and store)?
3. How do we display
* Config option ckan.status.enabled = False (by default)
=== Storing Data ===
How does ckanext-googleanalytics do this? Current table:
package_id | count_recent | count_total
Move to a new stats_summary table
id | item_id | object_type | stats_type (total, month_yyyy_mm, ...) | value
Do we store this data into the search (solr) so we can search by it?
=== Displaying Data ===
 * Helper functions / dictize:
  * Helper function: h.stats_get(object_type, id, stats_type)
   * h.stats_top_ranked(object_type, number) -&gt; returns object_dicts or just labels or ...
  * Change to dictize
 * Location in the default theme (do we show for example in search results too!)
 * Support for ranking by most popular in search?
=== Tracking Data ===
* Our own solution (just write to site_tracking)
* Google analytics (plus extension for retrieving data) &lt;- would need a refactor
* Piwiki
==== Own Solution ====
site_tracking table
id | url | timestamp | action (page_view, resource_download) |
 * Make javascript to make request to ckan to store clicks and page views.
 * Add middleware so these requests do not go through pylons and just store data quickly.

for now will collect all and then decide which to use for display as gives us flexibility if needed

-------

why is group listing of datasets inconsistent with main search (TDH at least)?
should we make these consistent?

group listing allows downloading of resource without tracking (this should be fixed)

if we make listings uniform do we want the download links or not?

I don't like the term download when it is just a link (maybe that's just me - what would be better?)

we have fanstatic integration in ckan.demo work

tdh is it's own extension

h.snippet is in 1.7

ITemplateHelpers in 1.7

This allows most of the issues resolved.  Full removal of the IGenshiStream filter still neads some form of in template hooks but this is being looked at as a possiblity in ckan demo and can be considered out of scope for this ticket

The idea of this ticket is to separate TDH into an extension rather than it being incorporated into core.  This should help TDH by making it possible to push fixes without needing to do a new release of core.  It should also help make core more stable and as slim line as possible.  New features can be tested in TDH and then if they have a wider appeal they can be merged into core.

There is a strong desire for this within the dev team.

Thanks, I think there is overlap and I'm happy to leave that bit of work to you (or future ticket owner) I was just adding some brief notes to this ticket on some of the outcomes I'd like to see and hence why I'd be happy to simplify the icons.

please do not try to change the meaning of tickets/add features or they will just get closed as won't fix.

featured datasets is nothing whatsoever to do with this ticket so adding it to the ticket just causes me to get upset / demotivated etc.  please do not do this.  It ruins my day.

Also comments like see sams design is of no value without a url in fact it has negative value.

:(

I have changed the priority of this ticket to account for this but next time i'll just close it.

                          <td class="newvalue">I installed CKAN yesterday afternoon from source, using the instructions at

http://docs.ckan.org/en/ckan-1.7/install-from-source.html

Most things worked pretty smoothly and, luckily, when they didn't I
was lucky enough to have David Raznick on hand to help sort them out.
As a result I've made the following notes on where the doc could be
improved.

For some ghastly reason I am running Linux Mint, which is some variant
of Ubuntu. It's not 10.04, so no package, hence the source install.

Sec 2: Not wanting a mysterious file called 'pyenv' in my home
directory, I created a directory ~/ckan and typed 'virtualenv pyenv'
from there. Everything worked fine. But if I had needed the 'tip' it
would have been a little confusing. It would also be worth reminding
the user that the dubious package is one they've supposedly just
installed, so if that went OK, they won't need to worry about this.

The tip also isn't clear about under what circumstances I'd need to do
the 'easy_install pip' - I didn't need to (is that also only when
python-virtualenv is missing?)

Sec 4: This worked, but the example command for installing a
particular version is confusing. It says it is for 1.5.1, but
replacing '1.5.1' with '1.7' fails because there is a rogue 'c' in the
command.

Probably it would be better to use the latest version (1.7) as the
example anyway. Or is there a way of asking for the latest released
version?

I understand this checks out the whole Git repository with all history
- I can't imagine why I'd need to do this to build a particular
version. But David assures me it's very sensible.

Sec 6: This worked, but it wasn't very clear what the purpose of the
'List existing databases' step was.

Sec 8: So now I had to try to get Solr working using the instructions at

http://docs.ckan.org/en/ckan-1.7/solr-setup.html

This didn't work at all, in ways I can't now remember, to do with
Java. In the end David suggested using Tomcat rather than Jetty (don't
ask me what these do, but they have something to do with getting Solr
to work ...) and this turned out to be much more straightforward to
install and get working, with two caveats (below). David suggested
maybe Tomcat should be the default suggested in this doc.

- One problem with Jetty was to do with using the wrong version of
Java, which seemed to be fixed using "sudo update-alternatives
--config java". It didn't fix Jetty - not sure if it would also have
been needed with Tomcat.
- Soft linking the schema file didn't work - it seems Tomcat doesn't
like soft links. We made a copy.

After this everything worked, and I now have my very own CKAN. Hurrah!

http://docs.ckan.org/en/ckan-1.7/post-installation.html

claim to be for either package or source installations, but only work
as stated if you have done a package installation. E.g. after a source
install, "paster --plugin=ckan user add admin
--config=/etc/ckan/std/std.ini" doesn't work (the ini file is
somewhere completely different), but just typing "paster user add
admin" from the ckan directory is fine.

The instructions should also mention that the virtual environment
should be activated.

the reason for this is that controller/package.py renders the form `package/new_package_form.html` as part of it's work and then makes this available a `c.form` to the template.  I'm not sure I like this as an approach but it is how it is currently done.  If you split your form into a new template `package/new_package_form.html` then you get all the errors etc.

I think for now we should do this and then look at if doing it all in one template pass might be more sensible.

reassign to me if you want me to do this else I'll leave it with you

It would be nice to get this fixed and I'm loathed to suggest adding a version 4 hack.
If we make this change it will break things for existing users.  This behaviour has existed since the action api was added as far as I'm aware

So should we
a) leave it forever and document
b) break things and fix it - when 1.7.1 or 1.8?

tags what functionality do we want for this?  I can just reuse the facet_list snippet but then we have all sorts of interactivity.  Do we want this more a static list of tags (linked to somewhere but no add remove stuff)? seems more sensible I think

this is now in a snippet (jinja2 allows the selected="selected" more easily) needs some work still eg translation stuff and also maybe completely rewrite the snippet at some point.

Anyhow the functionality is there.  I added the button for no javascript working.
