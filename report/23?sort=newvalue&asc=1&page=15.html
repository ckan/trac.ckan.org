The thinking was that the input of these fields would be through the api so the empty string case did not arise.  These should clearly be converted to None (Null).

What issues in general?
Having done this lots of times before you always end up needing to write your own little validators as the standard ones never do what you want.  Thats the point of them. Look in ckan/lib/validators if you need examples.

So what you did was correct...

I agree that more information on the resource would be a good addition. It seems a bit of a different issue to just adding autocomplete though, with potentially far more changes to the codebase, so maybe it would be better discussed in a separate ticket/CREP. However, any new fields would presumably want to either be constrained or have an autocomplete and so can reuse the work done on this feature.

== nested transactions ==

VDM does not support sqlite, as it uses nested transactions.  I do not think vdm needs nested transactions. It can use a flush instead.  Here is the patch that works. All vdm tests pass.

== indexes ==

The index file 021_postgres_upgrade.sql in the migrate repository will not run as it uses syntax particular to postgres. Another will need to be made thats similar. sqlite does not support complex indexes like upper(text), so a work around will need to be found.

== unicode ==

The harvesting returns utf8 encoded strings and pysqlite dbapi only supports python unicode objects (as far as I can tell).  There will need to be a process in converting all strings that get into the database with string.decode("utf8")

== dates ==

Have not looked into this one too much. However, as sqlite stores everything as strings the timestamps appear to be failing on conversion back into python.

I have solved the above two issues before by adding attribute extensions to sqlalchemy mappers to do the conversions without effecting too much code.

== in memory sqlite ==

Some tests need to change in order to make sure the database is created first because the database gets lost each time.  In the tests that I have made pass, they run in about a seventh of the time as they do on postgres. 

== Other things to keep in mind. ==

 * Need a new flag in test.ini to remove full text indexing completely, or always use it with solr.
 * There are enough incompatibilities between the databases that you would also want to test against postgres as well, at least before a release.  
 * I would probably upgrade sqlalchemy first, so you will not have to the changes twice. The new versions are significantly faster too.
 * I have submitted a patch to #868 that makes the tests run about 2.5 times as fast and I think there are more low hanging fruit if the aim is test speed.

I did get some non deterninistic errors, the above seemed to fix them. A failed subtransaction is not handled well by sqlalchemy and I think this causes knockon effects due to the unresolved transaction.  I would stay well clear of them entirely if possible.

What are the errors you are getting??


My 2 cents. ignore me at will...

I would think about using a different backend for testing than production. [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2716847/sqlalchemy-sqlite-for-testing-and-postgresql-for-development-how-to-port look here].
If you want to support both then you should test on both. 
There are simple ways to scrape a few more minutes off the tests.  If you want real speed, then a multiprocess solution (with a database per core) would be sensible if a bit tricky.

                          <td class="newvalue">I installed CKAN yesterday afternoon from source, using the instructions at

http://docs.ckan.org/en/ckan-1.7/install-from-source.html

Most things worked pretty smoothly and, luckily, when they didn't I
was lucky enough to have David Raznick on hand to help sort them out.
As a result I've made the following notes on where the doc could be
improved.

For some ghastly reason I am running Linux Mint, which is some variant
of Ubuntu. It's not 10.04, so no package, hence the source install.

Sec 2: Not wanting a mysterious file called 'pyenv' in my home
directory, I created a directory ~/ckan and typed 'virtualenv pyenv'
from there. Everything worked fine. But if I had needed the 'tip' it
would have been a little confusing. It would also be worth reminding
the user that the dubious package is one they've supposedly just
installed, so if that went OK, they won't need to worry about this.

The tip also isn't clear about under what circumstances I'd need to do
the 'easy_install pip' - I didn't need to (is that also only when
python-virtualenv is missing?)

Sec 4: This worked, but the example command for installing a
particular version is confusing. It says it is for 1.5.1, but
replacing '1.5.1' with '1.7' fails because there is a rogue 'c' in the
command.

Probably it would be better to use the latest version (1.7) as the
example anyway. Or is there a way of asking for the latest released
version?

I understand this checks out the whole Git repository with all history
- I can't imagine why I'd need to do this to build a particular
version. But David assures me it's very sensible.

Sec 6: This worked, but it wasn't very clear what the purpose of the
'List existing databases' step was.

Sec 8: So now I had to try to get Solr working using the instructions at

http://docs.ckan.org/en/ckan-1.7/solr-setup.html

This didn't work at all, in ways I can't now remember, to do with
Java. In the end David suggested using Tomcat rather than Jetty (don't
ask me what these do, but they have something to do with getting Solr
to work ...) and this turned out to be much more straightforward to
install and get working, with two caveats (below). David suggested
maybe Tomcat should be the default suggested in this doc.

- One problem with Jetty was to do with using the wrong version of
Java, which seemed to be fixed using "sudo update-alternatives
--config java". It didn't fix Jetty - not sure if it would also have
been needed with Tomcat.
- Soft linking the schema file didn't work - it seems Tomcat doesn't
like soft links. We made a copy.

After this everything worked, and I now have my very own CKAN. Hurrah!

                          <td class="newvalue">I know this is tricky. The issue is that Datastore does not exist *just* to provided data views - it also provides a bunch of other stuff like a Data API and, well, a Datastore. I also think there are different audiences. Data view info is about publishers and (viewing) users, while the Data API is for (non-CKAN) devs and CKAN devs and the Datastore sysadmin section is for deployers.

My feeling is therefore keeping things as is but with more stuff in the Data View seciton about it all works:

 * Data viewer: explanation for publisher, links to next 2 sections 
 * Datastore page (as we have it)
  * Includes datastorer 
 * Using Data API page (as we have it)

So main change is a better data viewer page ...

                          <td class="newvalue">I like rgrp's idea to change the model. But since it's complicated it would be good to have a UI.

e.g. You might make format field simply a drop-down with only some common options: 'CSV, Excel, Zip, Other'. If you go for Other, then a more substantial UI appears, to cover more filetypes, APIs, services and a text box for Other. And if you select 'Zip' then another set of options appears to say what is in the zip. etc.etc.

Another approach would be to have a background process downloading the data file and filling this in for you.

For example, to list rights you just loop over obj_classes to call {{{model.Session.query(obj_class).all()}}} and then display the values: {{{type(subj).__name__, subj.name, role, type(obj).__name__, obj.name}}}. 

To change a right you simply call {{{model.add_user_to_role(subj, role, obj)}}} or {{{model.add_authorization_group_to_role(subj, role, obj)}}}.

But of course if there is useful stuff to factor out then be my guest!

The idea would be to do the following things: 

1. Create a registry mapping format extensions to mime types: RepresentationRegistry.add_format('json', 'application/json')
2. Create a registry of (mime types, entity types) -&gt; converter functions that yield an appropriate representation of the entity. 
3. Hook this into the _finish method of the API controller based on Accept: handling
4. Add support for /api/rest/ENTITY/NAME.{format} and /ENTITY/NAME.{format} to routing, use registry from (1) to rewrite accept headers. 
5. Register converters in load_environment or via IConfigurable plugins
6. Document

There are ideas being suggested for replacing bits of front-end, but forms hard to do, and David's new system is a significant offering on top of the CKAN back-end, so it seems crazy to me to abandon it.

forms.rst has been updated by David Raznick in the release_v1.4.1 branch.

i18n.rst - include here the creation of the pot file, deploying a translation, transifex admin

load-testing.rst - I think performance should be mentioned in the glossy guide (some sort of basic metrics of speed profile, to return web pages, run searches and API operations, for 100 or 1000 packages, on a given spec machine) and have it based on a report showing how we measured it. The report would look a bit like this file, and it might do as a stub, but it seems pretty lacking.

distributed.rst - agreed, remove.

design.rst - agreed, delete.

loaders.rst / loader_scripts.rst - yes move to wiki

feeds.rst - this should be split into a tutorial for the wiki and the reference page left in sphinx

importer.rst - this should be moved to ckanext-importer/doc

admin.html - this has already gone in 1.4.1

authorization.rst - This is a bit jumbled. We're talking about changes to the code, so maybe not worth working hard to make this good, so I suggest leaving it, but delete the boring section "Requirements and Use Cases".

deb.rst - this is an administrator task, so should stay why move this to the wiki?

buildbot.rst - ok to stay here?

vm.rst - I assume there's no problem with this

                          <td class="newvalue">I see two possible options:

Option A: store only mirrors of source files, have file format based plugins for querying files

Option B: store mirrors of source files, have plugin based loading scripts into "common structured format", have single query module.

I would go with option B as it is:

- easier to implement - file format based transformations are simpler than file format based queries
- more transparent data management process
- only one simple query module
(see attached  ckan-srcmirror.png)

The Option B will fit better to the broader data architecture context:

Concerning API I would suggest to try to be compatible with google spreadsheet API:

It would be good to have some clear examples of things that would be in the extension.

I deliberately didn't suggest any detail on the authz front because I know other related changes are afoot so it would be useful for David Raznick to contribute here.

I really like the url ideas - more like github. /&lt;agent&gt; having a list of packages and a search box, plus a link to the latest revisions would be great. /package/&lt;package_name&gt; would usefully redirect to /&lt;agent&gt;/&lt;package_name&gt;. I do think this should be split off into a separate ticket though. What do you think?

Maybe we should change the JS to realise that it is at the login page and do something different than pretend to still be uploading?

For example need to be clear on the purpose of a user dashboard vs say a publisher dashboard. I image a publisher dashboard would have the stats to datasets belonging to that group (e.g. views, downloads, comments, shares, ratings), issues reported (when we get that extension working), call to action to add a new dataset (that adds it to the group).

User dashboards I'm less clear about. May be we can talk about this on Tues/Wed? Or skype today
