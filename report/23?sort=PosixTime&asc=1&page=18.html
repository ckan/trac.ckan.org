                          <td class="newvalue">UserGroup/PackageGroup might also be confusing.

A PackageGroup is *just* a group of packages.

A UserGroup is both a group of users, and a thing affecting authorizations.

Perhaps PackageGroup and UserAuthorizationGroup? Or PackageGroup and AuthorizedUserGroup?

I was quite confused by all this at first.

I think I understand how the whole thing works pretty well now, and I still can't think of good names for the two concepts, although I can already feel the normal English meanings of the words changing to what I now know they are for.

We should be a little wary of this. Things that are even slightly difficult to understand end up being understood by very few people. Would any of us be prepared to sit an exam on exactly how UNIX file permissions work, even though we all use them?

                          <td class="newvalue">The proposal is not comparable to PEP and DEP because the projects have vastly different requirements. The API stability needs of a programming language or an operating system (e.g. fundamental building blocks that you don't expect to change often or radically) are very different from a web application. The plone one is comparable.

The idea itself is a double-edged sword. It will promote stability which is good but can also tend towards rigidity and stagnation which is bad. Each added bit of bureaucracy and process means fewer people will be willing to collaborate or participate in improving the software.

The cli rights command doesn't appear to add the roles that it says it adds. Possibly because it's not doing the required commit? Reported this as a different bug.

                          <td class="newvalue">Great proposal, here's my thinking:

 * The current VDM model (where we have things like a single package table which logs changes to a package_revision table) is very well tested and works well and we should only consider a radical change with good reason
 * Although we are making a move from *model objects* being the central components to the *logic layer functions* being the central components, there is no need yet to have the database structures we store (for revisioning or otherwise) start to look like the dictized representation. The logic layer itself is designed to do that mapping.
 * Since we do have this logic layer though, there is less need for "magic" SQLAlchemy objects to support dicts and lists (eg the stateful objects used to make a list of tags on a package behave like a list), a few simple (and easily debuggable) queries in the logic layer would work better.

In the longer term we may want to look at serialising more dictized-looking objects and that may lend itself to a more dictized changeset model or even a more dictized storage system (eg no-SQL) but for the time being we are not at that point.

I recommend the following:

 * We continue to use the current default branch of VDM (not the changeset branch)
 * We continue to treat the package table (and other non-revision tables) as the most recent revision (even though the *active* revision displayed in CKAN might well be in the revision tables because more recent changes haven't been moderated yet)
 * We slowly stop using stateful lists and dicts in CKAN because we have move control with explicit queries in the logic layer

Sound good?

Yes, I agree with all this, but as initial thoughts I suggest that for phase 1, the info() method returns one more key called "form_config_interface" which takes a string representing a the type of interface for the config field on the form. If the key is missing it is treated as "None".

The two possible values are:

None - the field is not present and must always be stored as NULL
Text - a single text field will be provided on the interface

Whatever the interface, the value built will always be stored in the config column of the table.

We then also provide a "get_schema()" method that returns a schema cablable of parsing the data submitted by the form and storing it as a single key named "config". ckanext-inspire will then add other functions to the schema for URL etc so that regardless of what the harvest plugin does, the key fields ckanext-harvest are always there.

This then allows:
* Customiseable config interfaces
* Customisable valiation
* A consistent place to store config in the database

Sound good?

Some general conclusions relevant to both:

 * General feeling is not to change to changeset model
  * I'm personally +0 on changeset model
  * I would note main benefit is simplicity and orthogonality of changesets to core system. I also think cost of change is small.
  * That said we can simplify current model as well.
 * There seems some misunderstanding: change to have logic layer has almost nothing to do with being able to remove main stateful stuff in vdm. To be able to remove most of stateful stuff in vdm requires us to make some other changes (re foreign keys from revision objects to continuity)
 * There are other simplifications we should make to vdm before embarking on this (e.g. move to SessionExtension from MapperExtension). This is easy as that work has been done in changeset branch and can be backported.

What I don't see in this CEP as yet is any discussion of the complexities around pending stuff (e.g. do we allow multiple pending, do new edits get shown current or latest pending). I'll try and comment more on this but a lot of this was in original vdm discussion last summer.

                          <td class="newvalue">&gt;  * There seems some misunderstanding: change to have logic layer has almost nothing to do with being able to remove main stateful stuff in vdm. To be able to remove most of stateful stuff in vdm requires us to make some other changes (re foreign keys from revision objects to continuity)

The logic layer does not automatically help out, however it makes our life easier if we want to handle state ourselves.  For example take package tags, if we remove the stateful_m2m properties and just use normal sqlalchemy relations. We will still want statefullness (i.e active, pending, deleted) on the package_tags table. We should update those on the table ourselves in the  logic layer.

&gt;  * There are other simplifications we should make to vdm before embarking on this (e.g. move to SessionExtension from MapperExtension). This is easy as that work has been done in changeset branch and can be backported.
I agree but event thought the MapperExtension way is not great, it is very well field tested.

The clients should be entirely state aware.

The only thing that needs to be done is to remove all statefullness of relations.  These are the only things that are complicated.

This would make vdm just a simple copy on write mechanism, with the client controlling the state.

Also I think we may need to do a bit more to clarify when you just do a good ticket and when one does a CEP (looking at what has occurred already). I think this may be one reason to keep CEPs separate in drafting from trac as will clearly distinguish CEPs from standard tickets.

Further question: which extensions should be installed as standard?  I would argue:

 * ckanext-stats
 * ckanext-googleanalytics
 * ckanext-disqus
 * ckanext-solr (implies installing a running solr, too...)
 * ckanext-follower
 * ckanext-admin

Note that googleanalytics and disqus both require user accounts set up at the corresponding service.  Not sure how we would handle this in the instance setup.

+1 to the list above.

I also agree we should install solr by default. Who has actually done a CKAN solr install? I haven't but together with whoever has I can try to package it up.

Wrt to usernames and passwords, I'll look into how dpkg manages those blue pop-up screens for entering configuration options.

The idea would be to do the following things: 

1. Create a registry mapping format extensions to mime types: RepresentationRegistry.add_format('json', 'application/json')
2. Create a registry of (mime types, entity types) -&gt; converter functions that yield an appropriate representation of the entity. 
3. Hook this into the _finish method of the API controller based on Accept: handling
4. Add support for /api/rest/ENTITY/NAME.{format} and /ENTITY/NAME.{format} to routing, use registry from (1) to rewrite accept headers. 
5. Register converters in load_environment or via IConfigurable plugins
6. Document

 * Renaming: separation between ckan.org and ckan.net
 * More documentation in the code ...
 * Config options generated from code or move this to WUI ...

                          <td class="newvalue">I really think forms are a key asset of CKAN, and keeping the docs about customising and integrating them is important - i.e. forms.rst and forms-integration.rst. There are ideas being suggested for replacing bits of front-end, but forms hard to do, and David's new system is a significant offering on top of the CKAN back-end, so it seems crazy to me to abandon it.

forms.rst has been updated by David Raznick in the release_v1.4.1 branch.

i18n.rst - include here the creation of the pot file, deploying a translation, transifex admin

load-testing.rst - I think performance should be mentioned in the glossy guide (some sort of basic metrics of speed profile, to return web pages, run searches and API operations, for 100 or 1000 packages, on a given spec machine) and have it based on a report showing how we measured it. The report would look a bit like this file, and it might do as a stub, but it seems pretty lacking.

distributed.rst - agreed, remove.

design.rst - agreed, delete.

loaders.rst / loader_scripts.rst - yes move to wiki

feeds.rst - this should be split into a tutorial for the wiki and the reference page left in sphinx

importer.rst - this should be moved to ckanext-importer/doc

admin.html - this has already gone in 1.4.1

authorization.rst - This is a bit jumbled. We're talking about changes to the code, so maybe not worth working hard to make this good, so I suggest leaving it, but delete the boring section "Requirements and Use Cases".

deb.rst - this is an administrator task, so should stay why move this to the wiki?

buildbot.rst - ok to stay here?

vm.rst - I assume there's no problem with this
