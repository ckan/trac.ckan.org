I've created some js translations note that they are untranslated except for zh_TW which is mangled.  At the moment they are just a json blob in public/base/i18n/&lt;locale&gt;.js


What more do you need? It seems to me that you just need either


`some_var = {json}`  or  `some_function({json})`


let me know your preference or do we want this purely as an ajax call?  If it's ajax I think we want a common approach like in http://trac.ckan.org/ticket/2698 which I prefer to a unhelpful response

If we want something more sophisticated, determine an appropriate fallback etc, then I think the API is the way to go. Or we could get CKAN to determine the appropriate language file and include it in the page source...

This line needs to be added to the config.ini to get the CKAN logo back.

For other local sites remove the logo and the site title and description will be used. Currently the design doesn't handle a long description so beware.

This is possible via /ckan-admin/config

but renders badly with the demo theme disabled due to hiding behind that black rectangle - maybe we can do something?

I'm just closing this

a) Because the ticket doesn't really mean anything what is `properly` also a link to some random website does not help.  The ticket should tell me exactly what is wanted not be some sort of treasure hunt.

b) This is major feature creep - we have agreed the tickets for phase 3 small things/bug fixes are fine but this possibly a massive thing.  For weird stuff like this maybe you should save them up for when we have a meet up.  You need to get buy-in from developers I need to have some sort of pride in what I do.

c) I don't think this is a good idea from a technical perspective - maybe if you create a meaningful ticket it may make more sense.

d) Also I'm not doing anything involving maps till we have proper attribution of the map we are using on the demo site because I have morals, I thought okfn did too but I'm not sure any more.

Sorry to have to do this but it is for my sanity.  As I have repeatedly said the tickets are really important as they are the basis of all the work that I do.  They need to be of a reasonable standard.

I added this post discussion about attribution. Sam says that if we actually use the app itself (currently we're using the maps from it - but primarily by taking screenshots instead of actually integrating) then the attribution would automatically show.

In terms of ticket creating, I added this so people could see it and have a think about whether it's phase 3 or phase 4 (&amp; move where necc) &amp; whether you wanted more detail from me etc or whether it needed to be a more generic kind of ticket (i.e. 'need some low cost / low maintenance way to create backgrounds for demos').

In future, shall I email instead? Call on skype? IRC? before any tickets are created?

I'm happy to discuss things on irc/email if you are unsure about things.


If There are tickets that you are not sure about when they are wanted, then add them to phase 4 as they can then be ignored for now - anything added to phase 3 is a "this needs doing now" thing and as we have agreed exactly what we are doing in this phase (last week) then adding new features will likely get a negative reaction.  So if not sure add it to phase 4 - aron and I may do some phase 4 tickets if we feel they will be quick and easy.


As I've said small things like the breadcrumb is wrong on page xxx or bugfix tickets are fine as broken stuff needs fixing.  Sometimes it may not be clear how much work something will be or who the person who needs to fix it is - so just ask first.


The main problem with this ticket is that it is unclear what the ticket is about.

I've done most of this

to test

get strings
{{{ python setup.py extract_messages }}}


mangle the zh_TW creates .po/.mo files - I may need to fix plurals
{{{ paster trans mangle -c .ini }}}


create .js files only zh_TW will be correct due to other .po/.mo files being 1.7 ones
{{{ paster trans js -c .ini }}}


/api/i18n/zh_TW should be correct


please note we do not have en.js I'm returning {} I think this is the correct response (maybe something else as we should just use the default _('...') strings - maybe we need to do something else


for what it's worth pojson does not provide the format you wanted so I adapted it


reassign if you need fixes

"Groups allow you to group together datasets under a organisation (for example, the Department of Health) or topic (e.g. Transport, Health) so make it easier for users to browse datasets by theme.

Groups also enable you to assign roles and authorisation to members of the group - i.e. individuals can be given the right to publish datasets from a particular organisation."

But even that could be clearer. 

Mark's text could be misleading since we haven't currently implemented private datasets or the right auth settings.

Groups allow you to group users and data together so that they are easier to manage. Group owners can assign roles and authorisations, giving each project or department control of its own data publishing.

Users can browse or search by group, making it easier to find the data they are looking for.

Actually I see you also want some text changes

please don't add unrelated discussions to tickets as it causes noise is disruptive and I just end up closing tickets as won't fix etc.

I have updated the text as it was assigned to me and so i am still keeping this closed as I did as requested. Can you an ira sort this out between yourselves and create a new ticket when you have agreement

Thanks

This is an issue with the related items schema - I'm not quite sure what all the rules should be 

eg does visulisation need image url? or is normal url ok?

Could you review the schema and ensure that we require/don't require the correct items.  If you provide the rules I can help do the schema if you want but I don't know them

cheers

this is the correct behaviour as this is a partially added dataset - rewritten ticket as it has a nice number :)

I'd love it if we could pass it as an arg ie

form.input(...., extra_info=&lt;something escaped if not literal()&gt;)

also while we're at it I'd also really like

form.input(...., help_info=&lt;something&gt;) that would give a (?) icon with a :hover {display:block} div - that make sense?

This is fixed need to reload data to test though.

2.
Fixed as far as I am concerned, limit 0 now returns correct total.  If there are no results in filter return total of 0.
