Although changing the definition of 'editor' to not allow edit (as you admit) is a bit hacky, and I think prone to confusion. James and I weren't aware there was a precedent for doing it this way, but if we had, we may well have followed it.

I mentioned the branch for this cset, in preference to the csets.

At the moment we are not adding migrations to remove the harvesting tables. We are designing a harvesting refactor and will write migrations once the refactor is complete so that instances that use harvesting get upgraded, and those that don't get their harvesting tables removed.

Also, see this #1030 for the moving harvesting out of the REST API.

    * When I visit /package/read/xyz?rev=yyy I should be shown package at revision yyy

Could you please investigate how doable this would be given the current package read.html page. I expect it could be very easy once the revision API is in place because we could build a c.pkg object from the revision data instead of the model data.

Perhaps another case where we could try introducing the dictization?

One edge case to consider too - currently we don't allow reuse of the name of a deleted package, which is confusing. The deleted package should be moved aside (renamed), unless the deleted package is entirely the same as the new or renamed package.

Simply putting in the package revision object in place of the package does not work.
It will obviously work for changes to the package object itself. However, there are no  mappers on that object for getting out the related package_tags, resources and extras at that revision.  You will have to construct a fake pkg object with some messy and painful queries using dates.

The help text could explain what the response meant but more importantly would show examples of other calls you can make with the IDs returned such that the whole API is discoverable without anyone ever needing to read any docs! It also means the API documentation is more likely to be up to date since it will be obvious to developers when it isn't.

With help=False, the JSON can have all whitespace stripped too for production use.

I also think there should be no distinction between GET and POST so that people can easily link to API calls if they want to.

The tests have uncovered some inconsistencies in the use of SITE_READ between reading/editing a package in the Web interface vs the REST API. Friedrich, do you want to take a look at ckan/tests/functional/test_authz.py:TestSiteRead.test_pkggroupadmin_read for details and have a think about how this should best work. How about making SITE_READ more widespread in the WUI, to protect read/editing/searching things, in addition to the READ and EDIT RoleActions.

Once that is decided, it should be pretty easy to refer to the tests and document SITE_READ.

For example, to list rights you just loop over obj_classes to call {{{model.Session.query(obj_class).all()}}} and then display the values: {{{type(subj).__name__, subj.name, role, type(obj).__name__, obj.name}}}. 

To change a right you simply call {{{model.add_user_to_role(subj, role, obj)}}} or {{{model.add_authorization_group_to_role(subj, role, obj)}}}.

But of course if there is useful stuff to factor out then be my guest!

                          <td class="newvalue">David, thanks for writing those tests - perhaps we should combine them with the ones below ("TestLockedDownUsage") which attempt to basically do the same. 

As for the inconsistency introduced by the global check in the REST API you're right: Of course it is strange that WUI access checks are more granular than the API checks. The alternative is that we either move authz checks into all relevant REST places (a major refactoring I would be suspicious of) or that we introduce duplicate checks on the WUI actions (I actually have performance concerns about that, authz is incredibly slow - and it introduces another level of special authz that I think we really should not have). Given the choice I'd opt for the REST refactor - there is no good reason to make SITE_READ a duplicate check where authz already applies. 

On the other hand, this is a function we really don't want to enable or even have and that was only added to satisfy some very specific user demands. Given that these are fulfilled, I'm actually OK keeping the inconsistency for now - nobody will see it in normal operations and in a locked-down environment, users will need to have API keys anyway. 

Regarding the naming, I'm pretty opionion-less: SITE_READ was proposed by rgrp and I think its pretty fitting, while OTHER_READ would just confuse me. PUBLIC_READ might work, though.

I'm also happy to leave both TestSiteRead and TestLockedDownUsage as they complement each other nicely actually.

So I think all that remains for this ticket is to add a paragraph to the authz documentation about SITE_READ. Pudo would you mind doing this? It's well worth noting where it applies and where it doesn't.

i.e we should keep the data model really synchronised between the Web UI and API, (even if they are becoming divorced from the ORM Model - or maybe we should have a trashcan in the ORM model too?)

Ideas:
 * GET api/rest/package - lists active packages
 * GET api/rest/package/traffic_data - active package
 * GET api/rest/trash/package - lists deleted packages
 * GET api/rest/trash/traffic_data_old - deleted package
