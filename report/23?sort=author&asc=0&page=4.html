re flags it'd be nice to have more as the languages are not so fixed maybe that's too much work for this phase and is more wishlist

@shevski,

The language capitalisations should be correct they are from babel not us anyhow

As the new extension guru/deity I say helper functions are the future - my word is the law


a) a missing helper just returns '' so they can be added to templates even when not implemented, a missing template gives a 500


b) helper functions hide the implementation which I think is a good thing


c) helpers are just soooooooo cool - plus they are new and shiny (what am I saying?)


As far as moving the phase I'm not too fussed we can be ahead on phase 4

this isn't really needed then!  there is no point doing work if we need to do it again editing resources is easy enough now anyway

I suggest we just close this ticket as a won't fix and #2705 as well while we're at it.

I'm also not happy about these being added to the phase 2 milestone when we are at the end of finishing it and these are not bugfixes or critical functionality

I don't like auto submit as people may think (reasonably) that their changes are discarded.

We could catch all clicks and then ask the user if they've changed something but this feels a little crazy - better than the browser dialog.  hmmm

maybe we should discuss this ticket with the other backlog of undecided/unsure

personally I think we need to review the whole edit/view/delete logic as it feels real poor from my perspective - I need to edit something to delete it - that is a wtf imho

can you use links to s031 for stuff like this as it is the testing serve and i can play with the data more - unless the error is specific to demo.ckan.org

-------------

with this issue it is actually wider than you suggest as I cannot edit the group that the dataset is in either.  We need to discuss this one as I don't know the best approach should groups select datasets or datasets groups or both - how do we remove datasets from groups - who can do this etc - maybe next week?

I have disabled the sort order of group datasets in phase 2 as it is totally broken - I'll re-add it in phase 3

Also the comment you made you added bug2 - text covers order by box -PLEASE DO NOT DO THIS - all it does is make the tickets really hard to deal with - if this becomes a habit I will close all such tickets as INVALID as it makes trac unusable for developers - THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT - cheers

@aron,

can you watch for feature creep in tickets and let me know if it happens - thanks

It is much easier to work with tickets that only cover one thing - If something is found then the easiest thing is to add a new ticket.  If you feel it's related to another ticket then you can add that to the new ticket eg related to #1234

If tickets need combining it is easy for us devs to do it.  Basically adding something to a ticket is generally a bad thing.  Sometimes it's fair enough if something is missing for a new feature being reviewed etc - but even then a new ticket is generally not a problem.  Small tickets are nice to work on as we can close them quick etc.  The old [super] style tickets have been banned as they generally lead to owners becoming demotivated and unproductive.

It's always nice if you can find if a ticket already exists but I don't mind you opening a few duplicates if you can't find the ticket - for the demo you can probably just skim the tickets in the milestones as there aren't too many - but as you know I try to review them quite often.

Also please don't reopen really old tickets just add a new one If it's been closed in the last month or so then feel free to re-open if you're sure it's not just waiting for release - you can always check with the last owner of the ticket.

hope that makes sense

can you try to work out exactly how to cause this problem starting with `add a dataset` and let me know how you break things

tell me all the fields you filled in - also try to get it to happen using as little effort as possible  eg 
add dataset http://s031.okserver.org:2375/dataset/new

title = mooooo

click next:add data

resource = moo
format = csv

click `save &amp; add another`


click on resource just created in sidebar to edit

change format to `HTML,`  

click `Save &amp; add another`


etc


that all works fine for me what am i doing wrong?
thanks

Publishers vs Groups is more complex than I think is appreciated, is it really worth the time and effort just to make everyone using ckan confused?  Anyhow that discussion is not part of this ticket as it is not in-scope

I've added a data summary

The data errors for empty fields are not happening due to our use of repoze.who for logins which is crap and doesn't provide feedback re loggin details so not possible without hacking repoze which i'm not doing.


Could you look at cleaning up the error summary we don't supply a field name (key) as not relevant it would be nice if we could hide the :  also removing the invalid fields message would be good to hide maybe add this as an option to the macro

I've created some js translations note that they are untranslated except for zh_TW which is mangled.  At the moment they are just a json blob in public/base/i18n/&lt;locale&gt;.js


What more do you need? It seems to me that you just need either


`some_var = {json}`  or  `some_function({json})`


let me know your preference or do we want this purely as an ajax call?  If it's ajax I think we want a common approach like in http://trac.ckan.org/ticket/2698 which I prefer to a unhelpful response

This is possible via /ckan-admin/config

but renders badly with the demo theme disabled due to hiding behind that black rectangle - maybe we can do something?

in your .ini ie without the demo theme being used

I'm just closing this

a) Because the ticket doesn't really mean anything what is `properly` also a link to some random website does not help.  The ticket should tell me exactly what is wanted not be some sort of treasure hunt.

b) This is major feature creep - we have agreed the tickets for phase 3 small things/bug fixes are fine but this possibly a massive thing.  For weird stuff like this maybe you should save them up for when we have a meet up.  You need to get buy-in from developers I need to have some sort of pride in what I do.

c) I don't think this is a good idea from a technical perspective - maybe if you create a meaningful ticket it may make more sense.

d) Also I'm not doing anything involving maps till we have proper attribution of the map we are using on the demo site because I have morals, I thought okfn did too but I'm not sure any more.

Sorry to have to do this but it is for my sanity.  As I have repeatedly said the tickets are really important as they are the basis of all the work that I do.  They need to be of a reasonable standard.

I'm happy to discuss things on irc/email if you are unsure about things.


If There are tickets that you are not sure about when they are wanted, then add them to phase 4 as they can then be ignored for now - anything added to phase 3 is a "this needs doing now" thing and as we have agreed exactly what we are doing in this phase (last week) then adding new features will likely get a negative reaction.  So if not sure add it to phase 4 - aron and I may do some phase 4 tickets if we feel they will be quick and easy.


As I've said small things like the breadcrumb is wrong on page xxx or bugfix tickets are fine as broken stuff needs fixing.  Sometimes it may not be clear how much work something will be or who the person who needs to fix it is - so just ask first.


The main problem with this ticket is that it is unclear what the ticket is about.

I've done most of this

to test

get strings
{{{ python setup.py extract_messages }}}


mangle the zh_TW creates .po/.mo files - I may need to fix plurals
{{{ paster trans mangle -c .ini }}}


create .js files only zh_TW will be correct due to other .po/.mo files being 1.7 ones
{{{ paster trans js -c .ini }}}


/api/i18n/zh_TW should be correct


please note we do not have en.js I'm returning {} I think this is the correct response (maybe something else as we should just use the default _('...') strings - maybe we need to do something else


for what it's worth pojson does not provide the format you wanted so I adapted it


reassign if you need fixes

Actually I see you also want some text changes

please don't add unrelated discussions to tickets as it causes noise is disruptive and I just end up closing tickets as won't fix etc.

I have updated the text as it was assigned to me and so i am still keeping this closed as I did as requested. Can you an ira sort this out between yourselves and create a new ticket when you have agreement

Thanks

This is an issue with the related items schema - I'm not quite sure what all the rules should be 

eg does visulisation need image url? or is normal url ok?

Could you review the schema and ensure that we require/don't require the correct items.  If you provide the rules I can help do the schema if you want but I don't know them

cheers

this is the correct behaviour as this is a partially added dataset - rewritten ticket as it has a nice number :)

I'd love it if we could pass it as an arg ie

form.input(...., extra_info=&lt;something escaped if not literal()&gt;)

also while we're at it I'd also really like

form.input(...., help_info=&lt;something&gt;) that would give a (?) icon with a :hover {display:block} div - that make sense?
