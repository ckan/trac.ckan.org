Just wondering about the use of the c.form variable to insert the form into the page. I know we do this with the dataset and groups to support legacy templates, do we need to do this going forward? I'd rather each action just rendered one template and leaves it up to that to render the rest.

Toby, there's a couple of TODO statements in the code where the breadcrumbs need fixing. I think the templates just need access to the package dict.

https://github.com/okfn/ckan/blob/feature-2375-demo-theme/ckan/templates/related/pages/form_page.html#L6
https://github.com/okfn/ckan/blob/feature-2375-demo-theme/ckan/templates/related/edit.html#L5

Also if you generate an error message on one of the forms (leave the title blank) the error string comes out wrapped in quotes. eg. u'title is missing'

Also might be of interest, I've converted the templates to use Jinja, and this is a good example of the conversion.

For example, try pointing your browser to http://ckan.net/api/search/revision (ie without any arguments). Also, there is probably a lot less HTML than there was, since the errors are not handled as if it was an error within the "Web" user interface.
At any rate, perhaps we could work through the error cases, filling in the tests as we go? I think it's just unworked ground, rather than anything deliberate. :-)

Re. nested transactions.  I am getting repeated non-deterministic test failures against sqlite (and indeed postgres, but these failures appear more frequent against sqlite).  One of them I seemed to be able to get rid of by eliminating the savepoint as per your first point.  However, it appears that sqlite [http://www.sqlite.org/lang_savepoint.html does] support savepoints; to demonstrate it, the following test code appears to work in the latest sqlalchemy:

{{{
#!python
from sqlalchemy import *
from sqlalchemy.orm import *

db = create_engine('sqlite:///')

metadata = MetaData(db)

users = Table('users', metadata,
    Column('user_id', Integer, primary_key=True),
    Column('name', String(40)),)
users.create()

class User(object):

So, while I agree they're not needed, I'm not sure they're a problem.  What do you think?  Also, have you seen non-deterministic test errors like this?

I don't really agree with the people in the linked discussion who say it's pointless testing against a different database from production.

The goal here is to make it easy enough for people to run as many tests as possible that they actually do so.  Even 15 minutes is too long in that case.  With sqlite we can get it in at under 5 minutes.  I would also like to identify the longest running tests (which I would characterise as "functional" or "integration" tests and make them run as a separate suite, and then encourage a culture of writing true unit tests before functional tests, so that running unit tests can happen in 1 minute and be part of the regular development cycle.

That's no replacement for also running *all* tests periodically, and also running tests under postgres, which we can continue to do on the continuous integration server.  

Longer term I agree that it would be better to run local tests against postgres too, but that will I think involve refactoring many of the tests.

It doesn't matter much if it's implemented yet, that's why this is a demo. But anyway, here is a more generic but readable version based on Ira's text above:


Groups allow you to group users and data together so that they are easier to manage. Group owners can assign roles and authorisations, giving each project or department control of its own data publishing.

Users can browse or search by group, making it easier to find the data they are looking for.

The instructions should also mention that the virtual environment

Work that remains:

 * Add download click tracking to individual download links (currently we just record page views for packages, not downloads)
 * Somehow cache the download stats against each package (the Google API is very slow); package reddis or sqlite or similar as a local storage for the extension
 * Expose download information in the relevant places in the UI (all users? package owners? where?)

This is about 2 days' work.  Unlikely to get it done in this sprint.

{{{

}}}

Alternatively you can set the content type to "application/json" and you don't need to URL encode. e.g.:
{{{
curl -i http://localhost:5000/api/rest/package -d '{"name": "test5", "title": "Test &amp;"}' -H "Authorization:tester" -H "Content-Type: application/json;charset=utf-8"
}}}

To help work out these problems with encoding in the future, I've improved the error message to show the decoded JSON string. cset:55273629a552 which is headed for CKAN 1.5 release.

Having said that, there is no reason why a newer library shouldn't be introduced if webtest is not sufficient. And if there are stories without tests then it would be good to add them.

But note that I won't be offended if you close it as wontfix again. I agree this is pretty minor, and that working around old browsers' limitations isn't always a good idea.

* CKAN will have a CSW interface
* OS GenoNetwork will use this interface to determine:
  * New documents
  * Modified documents
  * Removed documents
* OS will then handle the serving back to the EU since GeoNetwork already implements the custom filters the EU may require (their docs are ambiguous).

This means the creation of the CSW server extension is now a high priority but it only needs to know about documents in the harvested_documents table. I've already implemented a REST API to get the those documents (but depending on the implementation it may need changing).

By importing the package controller at this earlier point, it sets the ckan_url quasi-global variable before the config file has been loaded.

In retrospect we should have not initialised the variables from the config during import.

The API stability needs of a programming language or an operating system (e.g. fundamental building blocks that you don't expect to change often or radically) are very different from a web application. The plone one is comparable.

The idea itself is a double-edged sword. It will promote stability which is good but can also tend towards rigidity and stagnation which is bad. Each added bit of bureaucracy and process means fewer people will be willing to collaborate or participate in improving the software.

Pawel is not available to work on these anyway at the moment, so let's pick them up as part of the disintegration work to migrate to CKAN. Marking the main ticket as "worksforme" since it does now.

Initially was hopeful that we could use openid (perhaps with oauth) but this does not seem possible (despite much talk of openid and oauth being complementary) ... Thus we shall adopt this old-fashioned approach.

  * A user who wishes to use the web api must obtain a web api key. They do this by:
    * Going to ckan.net and signing in using their open id.
    * Visit /account/apikey/: this should generate them a unique uuid key (or show their existing key if they already have one). This key should then be stored in the db along with their openid.
  * Once a user has an api key they must include in the request when making changes. This may necessitate an update to the restful api to start having a more generic message format (this also makes it more extensible for the future):
    * auth: auth key
    * data: data body (what we currently send)

This runs at the correct point for when the application runs normally. For testing however there are issues due to the tables potentially being dropped, especially for the sqlite case.   The fix is to make sure the iconfigurables are run at the start of each set of tests, hence adding it to the ckan_nose_plugin.   This is not pretty, but good enough.
