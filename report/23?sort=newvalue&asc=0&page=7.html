I want to see the activity stream for another user when I go to their user (profile/home) page.

#042 User
Subscribe to RSS feeds for activity in relation to packages, users, groups, tags (?)

#032 User
See  what status people have by seeing small bits of info next to their  name, e.g. a sign to indicate being a superuser/sysadmin and/or the  number of datasets they have. I know the approximate activity and authority of users I come across

                          <td class="newvalue">This ticket is essential I think. I would propose we should be a bit more radical here, though: 

 * Introduce an "Agent" SQLAlchemy object and derive both publishers and users via single table inheritance. 
 * Make agent the central object of authorization, e.g. by introducing c.agencies including the user account, visitor, logged_in, etc. 
 * Abolish AuthorizationGroups in favor of publishers. Yes, they are different but the use case for what AuthzGroups do and Publishers don't is just nerdery. 
 * Restructure URLs to be /&lt;agent&gt;/&lt;package_name&gt; rather than /package/&lt;package_name&gt; and have /&lt;agent&gt; be a useful list of managed resources rather than a revision list (users current home page).
 * Make Agents a primary facet for all kinds of navigation. 

Of course this would be done incrementally but I think we should agree on some such scheme as a marching direction.

Have decided to defer this issue for now, as it will be looked at when looking at making our whole extension system more robust early next year.

Related point:

 * We should provide a dashboard area (again via interfaces/hooks) that groups together report data from related extensions. So stats and googleanalytics info should be available from a similar area / url. This is also deferred until the extension overhaul/refactor.


Other outstanding issues:

 * Location / style of download count can be improved
 * Download count should be shown on resource pages

These should be looked at by whoever takes over frontend design.

At the moment they'll get a warning if they've edited the form telling them they'll lose thier changes. Perhaps we should submit the form using ajax, showing a spinner to the user, then send them on to the next resource.

This is the same situation as if we add an "add new resource" button to the listing.

The problem is that the cookie exists in your browser, but it is not valid, for whatever reason.

The solution is to change the css/javascript that displays the Register/My Account bit in the corner to talk to Auth, rather than just check for the cookie.

I agree that it doesn't seem right in this circumstance, but the way I setup roles is for 'editor', 'anon_editor' and 'reader' to have a fixed set of actions. See comment in ckan/model/authz.py:

{{{
# These define what is meant by 'editor' and 'reader' for all ckan
# instances - locked down or otherwise. They get refreshed on every db_upgrade.
# So if you want to lock down an ckan instance, change Visitor and LoggedIn
# to have a new role which for which you can allow your customised actions.
}}}

Basically it seemed wrong when people changed 'editor' to something that couldn't edit. They should call that role something else. 

But people *are* able to edit these roles (even though they are reset on upgrade) and they should be prevented. I've put this in a new ticket: http://trac.ckan.org/ticket/1679
