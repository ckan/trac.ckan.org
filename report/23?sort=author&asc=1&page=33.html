       see a form for "Add to do" at the top of the todo section and can add one straight away

       When clicked the todo fades away.

  Otherwise I see a button that says "login to add todo"

  The form

At the moment we are not adding migrations to remove the harvesting tables. We are designing a harvesting refactor and will write migrations once the refactor is complete so that instances that use harvesting get upgraded, and those that don't get their harvesting tables removed.

Also, see this #1030 for the moving harvesting out of the REST API.

Other ideas:

* The apps will need an image upload
* We might like a voting system for apps and ideas, potentially that could be re-used later. 

Let's discuss the above ideas after the basic functionality is in place.

The help text could explain what the response meant but more importantly would show examples of other calls you can make with the IDs returned such that the whole API is discoverable without anyone ever needing to read any docs! It also means the API documentation is more likely to be up to date since it will be obvious to developers when it isn't.

With help=False, the JSON can have all whitespace stripped too for production use.

I also think there should be no distinction between GET and POST so that people can easily link to API calls if they want to.

David Raznick and I have also agreed that for API 3, each call to the logic layer will return an object (basically a dictionary) rather than using Exceptions. This means the return values from the logic layer can exactly mirror the JSON data strucutres returned via the API. 

The help values can come from the docstrings of the logic layer functions.

The problem in the past was that the link was in the yellow box and there was no explanation as to why you had to login. This time you click from the header bar and there is a clear message saying "Unauthorized to create a group" - exactly as a user would expect. Even if the exact text of the ticket description isn't fully implemented in the current release, the UX isn't broken anymore. Yes, it might be even nicer to have a message warning them in advanced but these improvements will be taken forward in the UX work - maybe there is an even better solution than a message?

Since you are unhappy about closing it I'm marking it as "Duplicate" of #1521. As agreed earlier with the entire team, we'll take this forward as part of the groups refactor.

See #1521 for more information.

As a user I want to view a package at a given revision:

Could you please investigate how doable this would be given the current package read.html page. I expect it could be very easy once the revision API is in place because we could build a c.pkg object from the revision data instead of the model data.

Perhaps another case where we could try introducing the dictization?

* Log if the wrong type of URL is entered as an error the user can see
* Deny if the source is already registered
* Overwrite all extras, not just merge new ones.
* During the import stage use iswms.py to add an extra during import if it is a WMS so that we can add a link to the WMS later https://gist.github.com/900878
* Can errors/warnings be logged in the import stage? Do all fetched documents get passed to import in one go?

As far as progress on CKAN hosted goes, we now have:

* A build tool to package ckanext-dgu, ckanext-std etc into .deb files
* The ability to apt-get install CKAN
* A script that can set up multiple non-conflicting CKAN instances on the same machine

What we need next is the ability to generate a ckanext-xxx repository for each new instance we want to host. At that point most of the underlying techniques for hosting multiple CKAN instances concurrently will be in place. Once we have that working and know what clients want, we can look at going further and speccing up a multisite solution off a single DB, rather than the multi-instance solution proposed here.

                          <td class="newvalue">Great proposal, here's my thinking:

 * The current VDM model (where we have things like a single package table which logs changes to a package_revision table) is very well tested and works well and we should only consider a radical change with good reason
 * Although we are making a move from *model objects* being the central components to the *logic layer functions* being the central components, there is no need yet to have the database structures we store (for revisioning or otherwise) start to look like the dictized representation. The logic layer itself is designed to do that mapping.
 * Since we do have this logic layer though, there is less need for "magic" SQLAlchemy objects to support dicts and lists (eg the stateful objects used to make a list of tags on a package behave like a list), a few simple (and easily debuggable) queries in the logic layer would work better.

In the longer term we may want to look at serialising more dictized-looking objects and that may lend itself to a more dictized changeset model or even a more dictized storage system (eg no-SQL) but for the time being we are not at that point.

I recommend the following:

 * We continue to use the current default branch of VDM (not the changeset branch)
 * We continue to treat the package table (and other non-revision tables) as the most recent revision (even though the *active* revision displayed in CKAN might well be in the revision tables because more recent changes haven't been moderated yet)
 * We slowly stop using stateful lists and dicts in CKAN because we have move control with explicit queries in the logic layer

Sound good?

Yes, I agree with all this, but as initial thoughts I suggest that for phase 1, the info() method returns one more key called "form_config_interface" which takes a string representing a the type of interface for the config field on the form. If the key is missing it is treated as "None".

The two possible values are:

None - the field is not present and must always be stored as NULL
Text - a single text field will be provided on the interface

Whatever the interface, the value built will always be stored in the config column of the table.

We then also provide a "get_schema()" method that returns a schema cablable of parsing the data submitted by the form and storing it as a single key named "config". ckanext-inspire will then add other functions to the schema for URL etc so that regardless of what the harvest plugin does, the key fields ckanext-harvest are always there.

This then allows:
* Customiseable config interfaces
* Customisable valiation
* A consistent place to store config in the database

Sound good?

+1 to the list above.

I also agree we should install solr by default. Who has actually done a CKAN solr install? I haven't but together with whoever has I can try to package it up.

Wrt to usernames and passwords, I'll look into how dpkg manages those blue pop-up screens for entering configuration options.

 * it is fiddly
 * there is no advantage to the user as CKAN installation is so easy and so well documented
 * we don't want to have to maintain the image going forward
 * we might not want to promote a non-open approach

The guide will form part of Anna PS's work on the overall documentation but you can also see the original version here:
