Pagination – In the tag section of the site particularly I’d suggest replacing the traditional numbered pagination with alphabetical links, ie, display 26 links A-Z and then on each of those pages displaying the relevant tags. The point being that the tag pages represent an opportunity to index pages which intersect with very targeted search demand, so let’s give them all every opportunity to get crawled and indexed. Linking to all 26 alphabetically arranged pages from the main tag page (and maybe even the home page) will bring all the tag pages closer to the home page and give them all some more link popularity. Also suggest something similar to this for the listings in the Packages section, so arrange these on alphabetical pages.

Tag page titles – Take a programmatic, but more focussed approach to these. Currently all tag pages have the title “CKAN – Comprehensive Knowledge Archive Network – Tags – [tag]” – I would make this something like “[tag] – Open Data  – CKAN” or something like that which puts the emphasis on the tag keyword and adds some meaningful qualifiers to that.

Tag page listings – On the tag pages there are related open data sets listed and next to each the associated tags. This leads to masses of tag links on the page and loads of duplicated links. If possible I recommend removing the tags from each data set listing, and instead displaying a cloud of “Related tags” on the right hand side.

Group pages – The user curated group pages are possibly even better than the tag pages from a search perspective because they all intersect with very clear search demand, so would also benefit from having improved page titles. I suggest a similar approach to the above where the group name becomes the main keyword with some qualifiers added. It might even be a good idea to let group owners define their own page titles.

Data set pages – These also could do with improved page titles, presumably the data set name, eg. “[data-set-name] – CKAN”
Heading tags – not a big deal but I’m always in favor of using H tags strictly for headlines (rather than wrapping an H1 around the site logo for example).

 Change name of AuthzGroup? to UserGroup? to reflect what it is for
I think this is completely covered off in #1477 Group refactor

 Get rid of Roles, and replace them with direct assignment of actions, even though there are many actions, and extensions can add arbitrary ones.
 Debatable whether we should cut the number of actions to correspond to the three roles defined by the base system.
This is not clear - please raise a ticket for this if still promising.
 Have a method of finding roles (or, in future, actions) relevant to a given protection object (e.g. FILE-UPLOAD(ER) not relevant to Packages)
These three points I've moved into a new ticket #1596 as it was getting lost rather in this one.

 Change UserGroups? so that they can have a hierarchical structure,
I think this is completely covered off in #1477 Group refactor

Conclusion: closing this ticket as all points are covered or moved into tickets elsewhere

We need a safer mechanism for verifying that it's a text file or web page; a blacklist of filetypes which won't be iframed (GZIP, ZIP, etc) will never be adequate, and accidently starting a binary file download is a dangerous thing.

The fix is simple - commit: 17f33031f5e348e623146601f830b8c67462fe00

But more work will be required to relax this restriction.

n3 sounds useful, but given we could allow people to specify an RDF template we may as well do that as well as it would then suffice for ecportal who appear to want rdf as well.

Will check out json-ld as an option too.

Don't seem to be able to apply weighting to fields at index time using solrpy (see open issue: http://code.google.com/p/solrpy/issues/detail?id=6). So, switched to using the newer Solr edismax query parser and have applied weights to fields at search time.

Current weights are as follows:

name: 4
title: 4
group: 2
tag: 2
text (everything else): 1

For example, this simplifies the use of quotes in identifying tags in internal markdown links:

{{{
tag:"multiple word tag name"
}}}

A possible solution is to allowing escaping, such as:

{{{
tag:"something about \"Ian\""
}}}

But I think the compromise is a better solution than allowing the escaping as it's simpler, and this may crop up elsewhere.

SOLR indexing was excepting for new packages (tests such as ckan/tests/functional/api/model/test_package.py:TestPackagesUnversioned.test_entity_update_indexerror failed). The problem was (somehow) related to last_modified function using a new connection causing problems for the modified_metadata in finding the revision &amp; package table entries created during the commit. 

Changeset: [release-v1.5.1c 2c595ae] and cherry picked to [origin/defect-191-modification-date f98a4b2]

Suggest a filter function with an optional limit=15 argument, you pass it the whole activity list and it iterates over it until it has found 15 public ones then immediately returns those.

                          <td class="newvalue">A general comment: I wonder if we can pull the *core* part of that extension into core and strip out any external dependencies like rdflib. Specifically the 80% use of this extension is the DCAT read/write:

 * Get a Dataset / Resource etc as DCAT RDF (I'd suggest we *just* supply something simple like n3 or even json-ld (see below))
 * (Possibly not even essential) Consuming Dataset info in that format

And even more radical solution would be to simply use json-ld: http://json-ld.org/ which would then just involve minors mods to our json output.

Having this in core (with option to enable?) would be a nice 80/20 (it was this feature that everyone asked for at the LOD meetup -- no-one mentioned SPARQL).
