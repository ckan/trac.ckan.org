1) want to cache static files long term - need to add a ?ver=xxx to allow changes - this will need a change to all templates etc - could be seen as a good thing

2) we can only purge specific pages not whole cache so we need to know all the urls which want to be invalidated - including language variants

3) urls should be consistent so we should use id not name for datasets etc

4) for now we can just use short expiry times as this prevents some of these problems

It would be easy to move of course, but there is no real "developers" section in the official docs that I can see, and it's even called "CKAN's Administration Guide".

Furthermore, key dev info like how to setup and do extensions *is* already in the main docs (see http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/writing-extensions.html) and has been for 6m+. I've created #2226 for more work on docs and you may wish to comment there.

n3 sounds useful, but given we could allow people to specify an RDF template we may as well do that as well as it would then suffice for ecportal who appear to want rdf as well.

Will check out json-ld as an option too.

Pros:
  Easy to implement

  Fast execution

Cons:
   Requires knowledge of required RDF output if default is not useful
   RDF and not any of the other formats yet.
   Only works with package/resource/tags unless more work is done

It's 80% of the way there; some form CSS needs overriding because Bootstrap tends to make things very large so they spill over. But on the whole the markup is in a steady state, which is what we need.

 * Add -o option to only reindex datasets not already indexed
 * Add -i option to ignore exceptions when rebuilding
 * Add -r option to just refresh the index (not clearing it first)
 * Fix show command to show the index stored for a dataset
 * Add support for clearing the index of just one dataset

US1 As a Site Admin / Visitor (?) I want to see how often a page has been viewed (every page) and how often resources have been downloaded.
US1a Next to a resource or a dataset see how often it has been downloaded / viewed
US1b I want to see datasets or resources ranked by most downloaded or viewed
US1c See a trend graph for a dataset (and resources)
Adminstrative Dashboard (?)
    * I want to see the traffic breakdown by country to my site ...
    * Ditto for browser type, language, etc etc
    * I want to see it graphed over time ...
== Implementation Details ==
1. How do we store this data in CKAN?
2. How do we track (and store)?
3. How do we display
* Config option ckan.status.enabled = False (by default)
=== Storing Data ===
How does ckanext-googleanalytics do this? Current table:
package_id | count_recent | count_total
Move to a new stats_summary table
id | item_id | object_type | stats_type (total, month_yyyy_mm, ...) | value
Do we store this data into the search (solr) so we can search by it?
=== Displaying Data ===
 * Helper functions / dictize:
  * Helper function: h.stats_get(object_type, id, stats_type)
   * h.stats_top_ranked(object_type, number) -&gt; returns object_dicts or just labels or ...
  * Change to dictize
 * Location in the default theme (do we show for example in search results too!)
 * Support for ranking by most popular in search?
=== Tracking Data ===
* Our own solution (just write to site_tracking)
* Google analytics (plus extension for retrieving data) &lt;- would need a refactor
* Piwiki
==== Own Solution ====
site_tracking table
id | url | timestamp | action (page_view, resource_download) |
 * Make javascript to make request to ckan to store clicks and page views.
 * Add middleware so these requests do not go through pylons and just store data quickly.

Good question. WIll add to description.

&gt; &gt;  New datasets can be created from the organization form, in which case the organization will be set in the dataset form dropdown (with privacy set to private - see below)
&gt; Does this mean like the setup on groups on the datahub (i.e. forward to new dataset but with some things hard-coded, organization/group?)? Or does it mean actual new dataset form on organization page.

The former, although currently we will have a slightly different form in the organizations extension, until such a time as we're ready to replace the existing one.  Tried merging the two forms but it ended up with such a mess of logic that it was unmanageable.

Bootstrap allows us to delegate lots of clever functionality and layouts to Twitter's tried-and-tested code, making it easier to be compatible with IE7.

It has brought up plenty of issues: Lots of Javascript was broken; plenty of pages generate broken doctypes causing the browser to go into quirks mode (which in turn causes the page to explode all over the screen); most dynamic content would fail to generate properly in one way or another.... (see the #1788 branch for a log of issues encountered).

I've been refactoring our JS and have managed to strip ckanjs, too, because the only significant element we'd used was the File Upload view (which also now works in IE7).

test.ckan.net has been redeployed on master; I'm browsing the site in IE7 and everything is looking great :-)

for now will collect all and then decide which to use for display as gives us flexibility if needed



display
-------

why is group listing of datasets inconsistent with main search (TDH at least)?
should we make these consistent?

group listing allows downloading of resource without tracking (this should be fixed)

if we make listings uniform do we want the download links or not?

I don't like the term download when it is just a link (maybe that's just me - what would be better?)

When uploading a file:

- The "Browse..." button. This comes from the user's browser?

- Hangs when I try to upload a file, so the rest of this UI is unchecked.

The licenses on the dataset add, edit and view pages, "License Not Specified" etc.

Dataset state on dataset view page, e.g. "active".

When adding or editing resources:

- The resource types (Data File, etc.) The strings seem to come from resource.resource_type.

- "You can use Markdown formatting here", "Should a DataStore table and Data API be enabled for this resource?", "Dates are in ISO Format — eg. 2012-12-25 or 2010-05-31T14:30". I can't get strings with hyperlinks in them to translate here.

Dataset view page:

- License not specified.

Dataset search page:

- "Tags", "Res_format" and "Groups" in the sidebar. Leaving because this code has been refactored on feature-1821-multilingual-extension. Fix after that branch has been merged.

Dataset view page:

- The resource types, e.g. "plain text".
- The field names under additional information: cache_last_updated etc.

Dataset history view: timestamps not localised.

Login page:

- "Login failed. Bad username or password. (Or if using OpenID, it hasn't been associated with a user account.)" This string is marked for translation but I can't seem to get translations to work for flash messages. Also "Sean Hammond is now logged in" flash message.

Register page:

- "Missing value" in error message when you try to register and don't give an email. The string seems to come from formencode. stdtrans() not working?

User view page:

- Activity streams strings. Activity streams genshi function needs a little refactoring to be i18n-friendly.

Users page:
- "less than 1 month". This string comes from Pylons' time_ago_in_words() function which doesn't appear to support i18n.

New auth group (and edit auth group) page:

- "Unique identifier for group. 2+ chars, lowercase, using only 'a-z0-9' and '-_'". This string is marked for translation but for some reason it isn't working.

- "Name: Please enter a value" (in an error msg)

- "User name". The string comes from class FormBuilder?

Also, need to check that all tooltips are translated!

The idea of this ticket is to separate TDH into an extension rather than it being incorporated into core.  This should help TDH by making it possible to push fixes without needing to do a new release of core.  It should also help make core more stable and as slim line as possible.  New features can be tested in TDH and then if they have a wider appeal they can be merged into core.

There is a strong desire for this within the dev team.

                          <td class="newvalue">@toby: indeed and I'm strongly in favour of the basic idea too (and largely a dev question so up to you guys though feature / functionality implications would need to be talked through). My point was that custom icon stuff was #2224 :-)

Thanks, I think there is overlap and I'm happy to leave that bit of work to you (or future ticket owner) I was just adding some brief notes to this ticket on some of the outcomes I'd like to see and hence why I'd be happy to simplify the icons.
