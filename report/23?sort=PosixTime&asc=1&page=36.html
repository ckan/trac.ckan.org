I've added a data summary

The data errors for empty fields are not happening due to our use of repoze.who for logins which is crap and doesn't provide feedback re loggin details so not possible without hacking repoze which i'm not doing.


Could you look at cleaning up the error summary we don't supply a field name (key) as not relevant it would be nice if we could hide the :  also removing the invalid fields message would be good to hide maybe add this as an option to the macro

I'm just closing this

a) Because the ticket doesn't really mean anything what is `properly` also a link to some random website does not help.  The ticket should tell me exactly what is wanted not be some sort of treasure hunt.

b) This is major feature creep - we have agreed the tickets for phase 3 small things/bug fixes are fine but this possibly a massive thing.  For weird stuff like this maybe you should save them up for when we have a meet up.  You need to get buy-in from developers I need to have some sort of pride in what I do.

c) I don't think this is a good idea from a technical perspective - maybe if you create a meaningful ticket it may make more sense.

d) Also I'm not doing anything involving maps till we have proper attribution of the map we are using on the demo site because I have morals, I thought okfn did too but I'm not sure any more.

Sorry to have to do this but it is for my sanity.  As I have repeatedly said the tickets are really important as they are the basis of all the work that I do.  They need to be of a reasonable standard.

I added this post discussion about attribution. Sam says that if we actually use the app itself (currently we're using the maps from it - but primarily by taking screenshots instead of actually integrating) then the attribution would automatically show.

In terms of ticket creating, I added this so people could see it and have a think about whether it's phase 3 or phase 4 (&amp; move where necc) &amp; whether you wanted more detail from me etc or whether it needed to be a more generic kind of ticket (i.e. 'need some low cost / low maintenance way to create backgrounds for demos').

In future, shall I email instead? Call on skype? IRC? before any tickets are created?

I'm happy to discuss things on irc/email if you are unsure about things.


If There are tickets that you are not sure about when they are wanted, then add them to phase 4 as they can then be ignored for now - anything added to phase 3 is a "this needs doing now" thing and as we have agreed exactly what we are doing in this phase (last week) then adding new features will likely get a negative reaction.  So if not sure add it to phase 4 - aron and I may do some phase 4 tickets if we feel they will be quick and easy.


As I've said small things like the breadcrumb is wrong on page xxx or bugfix tickets are fine as broken stuff needs fixing.  Sometimes it may not be clear how much work something will be or who the person who needs to fix it is - so just ask first.


The main problem with this ticket is that it is unclear what the ticket is about.

Alternatively for better error handling we could use a JSON transport.

 * Client posts a blob of json containing a "content" key with the markdown string.
 * Server returns a 200 (application/json) and blob of json with a "content" key with the rendered markdown.
 * Server returns a 400 (application/json) and blob of json with a "error" key containing a useful message for the user.

At the moment they'll get a warning if they've edited the form telling them they'll lose thier changes. Perhaps we should submit the form using ajax, showing a spinner to the user, then send them on to the next resource.

This is the same situation as if we add an "add new resource" button to the listing.

I don't like auto submit as people may think (reasonably) that their changes are discarded.

We could catch all clicks and then ask the user if they've changed something but this feels a little crazy - better than the browser dialog.  hmmm

maybe we should discuss this ticket with the other backlog of undecided/unsure

personally I think we need to review the whole edit/view/delete logic as it feels real poor from my perspective - I need to edit something to delete it - that is a wtf imho

let's work out what we are doing before wasting energy on this

As the new extension guru/deity I say helper functions are the future - my word is the law


a) a missing helper just returns '' so they can be added to templates even when not implemented, a missing template gives a 500


b) helper functions hide the implementation which I think is a good thing


c) helpers are just soooooooo cool - plus they are new and shiny (what am I saying?)


As far as moving the phase I'm not too fussed we can be ahead on phase 4

I've created some js translations note that they are untranslated except for zh_TW which is mangled.  At the moment they are just a json blob in public/base/i18n/&lt;locale&gt;.js


What more do you need? It seems to me that you just need either


`some_var = {json}`  or  `some_function({json})`


let me know your preference or do we want this purely as an ajax call?  If it's ajax I think we want a common approach like in http://trac.ckan.org/ticket/2698 which I prefer to a unhelpful response

If we want something more sophisticated, determine an appropriate fallback etc, then I think the API is the way to go. Or we could get CKAN to determine the appropriate language file and include it in the page source...

the initial verdict is that our translation coverage is extremely poor and we need a full template review - maybe there is a jinja2 i18n solution but I think not without `{% trans %}`

Moving to phase 4 - also I'm just holding this ticket and will be allocating to aron's successor

Publishers vs Groups is more complex than I think is appreciated, is it really worth the time and effort just to make everyone using ckan confused?  Anyhow that discussion is not part of this ticket as it is not in-scope

Is the Suomi just Finnish? May be a darker blue. 

I would find some pointers useful: e.g. "Shqipe (Albanian)"

2. I'd love to be able to link directly to e.g. the 'top tags' view - any way to do this?
3. Is there any way to rate datasets at the moment? If not, can we hide that option for now?
4. On 'Revisions to Datasets per week' can we rename this 'Dataset revisions per week' and can we change the orange icon/index in the table to 'all dataset revisions' instead of referencing 'packages'

For example need to be clear on the purpose of a user dashboard vs say a publisher dashboard. I image a publisher dashboard would have the stats to datasets belonging to that group (e.g. views, downloads, comments, shares, ratings), issues reported (when we get that extension working), call to action to add a new dataset (that adds it to the group).

User dashboards I'm less clear about. May be we can talk about this on Tues/Wed? Or skype today

I've done most of this

to test

get strings
{{{ python setup.py extract_messages }}}


mangle the zh_TW creates .po/.mo files - I may need to fix plurals
{{{ paster trans mangle -c .ini }}}


create .js files only zh_TW will be correct due to other .po/.mo files being 1.7 ones
{{{ paster trans js -c .ini }}}


/api/i18n/zh_TW should be correct


please note we do not have en.js I'm returning {} I think this is the correct response (maybe something else as we should just use the default _('...') strings - maybe we need to do something else


for what it's worth pojson does not provide the format you wanted so I adapted it


reassign if you need fixes

re flags it'd be nice to have more as the languages are not so fixed maybe that's too much work for this phase and is more wishlist

@shevski,

The language capitalisations should be correct they are from babel not us anyhow

"Groups allow you to group together datasets under a organisation (for example, the Department of Health) or topic (e.g. Transport, Health) so make it easier for users to browse datasets by theme.

Groups also enable you to assign roles and authorisation to members of the group - i.e. individuals can be given the right to publish datasets from a particular organisation."

But even that could be clearer. 

Mark's text could be misleading since we haven't currently implemented private datasets or the right auth settings.

It doesn't matter much if it's implemented yet, that's why this is a demo. But anyway, here is a more generic but readable version based on Ira's text above:


Groups allow you to group users and data together so that they are easier to manage. Group owners can assign roles and authorisations, giving each project or department control of its own data publishing.

Users can browse or search by group, making it easier to find the data they are looking for.

Actually I see you also want some text changes

please don't add unrelated discussions to tickets as it causes noise is disruptive and I just end up closing tickets as won't fix etc.

I have updated the text as it was assigned to me and so i am still keeping this closed as I did as requested. Can you an ira sort this out between yourselves and create a new ticket when you have agreement

Thanks
