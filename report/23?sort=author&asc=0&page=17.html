 * How do I add Stats to a menu ...
   * ANS (?): Main menu: should make this configurable sooner rather than later (what about footers ...)
 * How do I have plugins support other plugins ...
  * E.g. stats incorporate QA info

== Extensions in Core ==

* Do we centralize templates and public directory or not ...
  * (+) quicker, simpler
  * (-) have to change things, does it mess up non-core extensions

* Tests: need to be run! (Put them into core area ...)

== Qu: Going forward how do we handle extensions and plugins ==

Specifically:

* Inclusion of html into *core* html - e.g. showing download counts ...
  * Concrete examples:
    * Including widgets into the dashboard
    * Including widgets in stats section
  * (not simply inclusion of html into routing system separate from core --
    which is relatively trivial)
  * More entry points?

== Other stuff I think we should look at ==

* config in dashboard

I'm much more interested in things like:

 * Is this down (all the time)
 * Has this been down recently
 * When was this last modified (not quality per se ...)

This is an area where referring back to the original user stories (if any) around QA is really useful.

I guess my feeling would be some of this should be about providing e.g. helper methods so that theme designers can incorporate things into their design with some work putting this into default CKAN theme.

 * Get a Dataset / Resource etc as DCAT RDF (I'd suggest we *just* supply something simple like n3 or even json-ld (see below))
 * (Possibly not even essential) Consuming Dataset info in that format

And even more radical solution would be to simply use json-ld: http://json-ld.org/ which would then just involve minors mods to our json output.

Having this in core (with option to enable?) would be a nice 80/20 (it was this feature that everyone asked for at the LOD meetup -- no-one mentioned SPARQL).

Rather than hack around the conditions of the format string for previewing, my strong suggestion is to get rid of weird format types like x-osdata-csv (just change it to csv).

An alternative, that would preserve ability to set 'funky' formats would be to set the mimetype correctly (to text/csv) (this may still need an update to the previewer but one that would be sensible to make).

                          <td class="newvalue">Having now thought about this I'm re-opening this ticket for the following reasons:

 * No real documentation (other than that in this ticket yet available)
  * It would also be nice to know how this maps to SOLR API (can i use all of the facet options solr provides or not ...?)
  * And I would again emphasize my preference for having *direct* access to something that looks *exactly* like SOLR API as I can then use client and docs from SOLR to work with it.
 * No clear resolution of separation between Action and REST API (and search API). Really seems to me there should be convergence between latter 2 (as suggested in the ticket) -- this would also resolve the problem that having GET /api/dataset return all datasets is *not* a great idea
 * The Action API requires a POST request. Since the primary purpose of the search API would be usage from JS it would be nice if GET and JSONP were supported. (Though given our CORS support we could argue this was optional).

Not saying *all* of this needs fixing but some clear approach here would be useful

Rather than update ckanext-apps I suggest we do a rewrite. I've created a detailed super ticket at #2204 and assigned to you Adria for review and thoughts. (While I understand #2204 may involve more work which we maybe cannot do before relaunch I'd still recommend starting on that rather than spending time upgrading this extension -- if we have to disable it for relaunch I don't think that is a big deal ...)

Does this mean like the setup on groups on the datahub (i.e. forward to new dataset but with some things hard-coded, organization/group?)? Or does it mean actual new dataset form on organization page.

Issue was that our auto-completion depended on structure of the HTML which changes with bootstrapification.

BTW: have deployed this via copy and paste on datahub so i can use it. Will want to revert this when you do a deploy.

@Ross: I note that the same bug probably affects organization auto-complete.

http://datahub.io/dataset?q=thatcher+wages

This returns 15 datasets yet only one of them has any mention of thatchers (the first one!). (The others are there because they match wages). This isn't what I expect. I expect *only* to see datasets that match *both* terms ...

 * Related is a pretty terrible name in the UI - much better to have it called Apps, Ideas etc (perhaps title tag could even give more details e.g. "Apps, Ideas, Visualization and other material related to this dataset") -- btw i thought this was in #2332 but realize it wasn't (apologies for that!)
 * Documentation, documentation, documentation - AFAICT I can't see anything in v1.7 or master docs. I imagine this would be a short section like http://docs.ckan.org/en/ckan-1.7/commenting.html (and probably coming right after that in the ToC) which says
  * What it does
  * How to enable (and perhaps includes a nice-screenshot!)
  * How to customize (e.g. can one customize the list of options of things one can create (e.g. can I set it to just be app and idea or ...)
  * Also liase with Mark W re a blog post about this from the user perspective (a screenshot walkthrough ...)
 * Clearly mark this old extension as deprecated from v1.7 forward: https://github.com/okfn/ckanext-apps (I just met someone last week who was working on integrating this and had no idea it was replaced by something better in v1.7)
