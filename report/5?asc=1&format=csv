Displaying the package: the Markdown processor respects both EOLs when displaying the field, putting each line in a <p> tag.

Creating the package edit form: placed into <textfield>. 

Browser displaying package edit form: <textfield> displays \n and \r\n as EOL. But \n\n gets compressed to one EOL. But on submission, both are returned as \r\n.

Receiving the edited package: Somewhere along the line the EOL gets converted to \n\n.

Functionality to formally associate packages. We see a need for specific parent-child, inheriting or dependency relations. Not only should this help navigation between packages in the web interface, but it also provides a mechanism to automatically pull dependencies when downloading a data package, in a similar manner as we see in software package management.

= Examples =

1. There are 27 packages in data.gov.uk to do with the Data4NR's Health Poverty Index. There is currently no common link between these, unless you search for 'HPI' (which also brings up House Price Index), or look under tag 'health' (which also has 600 other results). There should be a link on each HPI package page to navigate to the other 'sibling' HPI packages, and to a 'root' package that has info about the set. This could be partially achieved using the existing tag or group concepts, but a more explicit/official/obvious marking of their relationship could be beneficial.

2. In ckan.net is freedict, a collection of translation dictionaries. You could make each dictionary a child package and use this system. But it would probably be better to make each dictionary a different resource in the same package. (There are other ideas to denote a resource as the data making up a 'portion' of package, or a 'whole' of the package, to help people downloading datasets in the software package style.)

3. OSM has had some Naptan data imported (bus stops), with special permission - i.e. a more liberal license. It would be useful to show this link on both OSM and Naptan packages in CKAN: OSM 'derives from' Naptan with a comment about the license change. I'm not sure this is useful to an automatic download or use of these datasets, but may aid exploration on the CKAN website and understanding the provenance of the bus stop data on it.

4. IPCC collection of data linked / mirrored. Not sure if there are useful relationships here?

5. Dracos gets postbox locations from crowd sourcing and OSM. We could say Dracos 'derives from' OSM.

'''Simplifying uploads'''

Currently uploads are too painful/difficult/fiddly to use and/or configure.  We want to simplify uploads so that they are done directly to the CKAN server, without support for remote services (S3 etc) and/or the dependencies it introduces.

We want to fix:

 * File uploads themselves
 * Storage of uploaded files
 * Notification of the upload to other components
 
 
'''File uploads'''

Things file upload should do:

 * Allow sysadmin to disable
 * Allow auth'ed users to upload
 * Store whatever they send on disk, and store DB entry linking the file to the person
 * When creating the resource, the user should be able to choose from all of the files
   they have uploaded but not yet associated with a resource. This will allow for bulk
   upload and then a delayed association.  Whenver a user creates a resource they
   either upload a file now, or see previously uploaded files.

{{{
Can we do the upload asynchronously and then associate the 
uploaded key with the resource before the save ? What happens 
if the user tries to submit before asymc upload finishes ? Should 
we delay them?
}}}

The upload workflow should look like...

 1. File upload should be a straightforward file upload with normal auth checks and normal processing of the posted data.  
 2. 
     a. When called via ajax then the ID of the newly created file should be returned,
     b. When called via WUI then it should also be given the url to redirect to after the file upload has been handled - the id will be passed as a query param.
 3. The resource save should check whether it has a file id and in that case updates the file object to point to the resource.

This should enable:

 * Separate file upload into a user's temporary store, either individually or as a batch.
 * Creating resources and simply choosing from previously uploaded, unassigned files
 * Adding files/data to a resource after the fact.

   

'''File storage'''

File storage should be local to the CKAN install, and not a remote service.  Any archiving to remove storage providers should be outside of the main request.

File storage should:

 * allow moving data, a sysadmin should be able to move the storage root and change configuration and  have the system continue running (i.e. don't store absolute paths).
 * provide maintainability, it should be easy to determine which old files are not associated with resources  and thus can be cleaned up.
 * allow for collection of information (i.e. estimate of storate space used)
 * check whether there is enough space and handling the conequences cleanly
 * ensure files to be written only underneath its own root folder, checks should be made after any path generation that the file begins with the location of the file storage.
 * Have a configurable maximum accepted blob size during upload.
 * Should store what meta-data was provided with the upload, such as mimetype.

Somewhere in the DB we should store ...

||'''Column'''||'''Notes'''||
||id||An identifier||
||owner||The owning user, who uploaded the file||
||path||The path (from the 'storage root') to the file||
||size||The size in bytes of the file on disk||
||mimetype||The mimetype of the file, as provided by the uploader||
||upload_date||When the data was uploaded||
||resource||The ID of the resource it belongs to. A unidirectional relationship.||
||archived_url||The URL where this file has been archived||

Generating paths should try and separate the files, perhaps based on username of the owner, or some other mechanism to avoid a single folder full of files.


'''Notifications'''

We need to make sure that it is possible to notify other components within the system that an upload has taken place, or at least make it easy for them to be notified.  The primary use case for this is to notify the component that will translate/upload certain formats to the data store.

We could do this based on the post-upload update to the file model (i.e. when we record the total received size of the file).

icmurray,2550,User types,ckan,datahub-july,enhancement,2012-06-18T11:06:30Z,"== Requirements ==

In the data hub plugin we require the ability to differentiate users between those that have paid for a service, and those that haven't. The distinction isn't boolean as there may be levels of service for paid users, so it may be that we need a 'type' of user where there are various grades of 'paid' which are likely to be strings (specific to the data hub).

== Required interface ==

Once changes have been made to the user schema, for a given user we want to be able to:

 * determine if they have a paid or a free account, and
 * get a string name of the type of paid account.

Care should be taken to ensure that the 'paid' status of the user cannot be set through the API and only by the datahub plugin.

== User Stories ==


User stories related to the management, setting and changing of a user's payment level, as well as historical information on payments should be done as part of the work that includes actually allowing purchases.  For now it is adequate that we can manually control these things through paster commands.

Payments types should be linear as I don't believe for this type of service a pick-and-mix modular model would work well. Organizations will inherit the payment level of their owner, so currently there is no requirement for it to affect organizations at all.

 * As a sysadmin I would like to be able to use a paster command to
   manually set a user's payment level, or remove it entirely.

 * As a sysadmin I would like to be able to run a paster command to
   view a list of users who have a payment plan, grouped by the plan
   that they have.

 * As a sysadmin I would like to be able to use the API to change the
   payment status of a specific user through user_create and user_update.
   This shouldn't be available to anybody else.

We need to be able to easily determine who the owner of a dataset or group is.  Datasets and Groups should have an Owner, who may change over time but is a specific user within the CKAN instance.  It should be easy for CKAN components to determine the user and for the initial version we should ignore the can of worms labelled 'ownership transfer'.

At this point migration is likely to be the biggest issue, and would suggest that it is acceptable that the last user to edit a dataset be set as the current owner.

I don't think you want to actually purge the activities from the db, because you might still want them to appear in private activity streams.

I do think that when a dataset goes private all its past activity should go private, because I imagine that users are going to want to hide everything about the dataset and not have any past activities 'leaking out'

I don't think you want to consider whether the dataset was private when the activity happened, rather if a dataset is private now then all its past activities are private (and the simplest thing would be to say that if a dataset is public now then all its past activities become public as well, but is that a privacy concern?)

The easiest way to implement this is going to be by modifying the *_activity_list() action functions in get.py, after they pull their activity lists out of the db they should pass them through a function that filters out stuff about private datasets.

An activity about a private dataset is one whose object_type is 'dataset' and whose object_id matches the id of a private dataset. You should also check the object_type and object_id of all of the activity object's activity detail objects, if any of those match a private dataset then mark the whole activity as private.

Currently all activity streams are public so should have all private datasets filtered out from them, except for the dashboard activity stream which is private to the individual user. In this case private datasets that the user has permission to see should not be filtered.",2012-10-29T17:18:57Z,seanh

(Just as we have datasets listed that exist but aren't available ...)

Alternative would be to have a request for datasets subsystem.

I prefer the stub dataset model because it's simpler, provides a simple workflow (as a dataset is found or comes into existence), and the package page provides a natural space in which to accumulate information about what is wanted and what exists.

## dump filenames
ckan.site_url =

## Favicon (default is the CKAN software favicon)

## An 'id' for the site (using, for example, when creating entries in a common search index) 
## If not specified derived from the site_url
# ckan.site_id = ckan.net

## API url to use (e.g. in AJAX callbacks)
## Enable if the API is at a different domain
# ckan.api_url = http://www.ckan.net

## html content to be inserted just before </body> tag (e.g. google analytics code)
## NB: can use html e.g. <strong>blah</strong>
## NB: can have multiline strings just indent following lines
# ckan.template_footer_end =

NB: these will still need to be stored somewhere for loading on initialization. do this in db init function ...

=== Settings / Options / KeyValues Table ===

 * [namespace]: ? only if KeyValues (for settings this would then always be settings)
 * key
 * label
 * value (json)
 * type (e.g. date and to specify in advance what type should be)
