 * Got existing API systemin in ckanext-storage fully working (e.g. api section was broken -- maybe due to changed boto ...)
 * API now supports GET requests and JSONP where appropriate
 * Added auth form to API (could be useful for ajax form stuff going forward)
 * Improved UI of upload including having ckan based file links (using redirects)
  * Set uploaded-by field on uploaded files 
 * Checked on AWS And GS

Also did:
 * Improved ofs in various ways including change to standard metadata handling and improved testing (see e.g. https://bitbucket.org/okfn/ofs/changeset/36fac29b7775)
 * Tracked down [https://github.com/okfn/boto/commit/0d9635c8a9785c9b20b44ee93a0679c002961592 bug with boto and metadata updating on GS] and provided patch.

As far as progress on CKAN hosted goes, we now have:

* A build tool to package ckanext-dgu, ckanext-std etc into .deb files
* The ability to apt-get install CKAN
* A script that can set up multiple non-conflicting CKAN instances on the same machine

What we need next is the ability to generate a ckanext-xxx repository for each new instance we want to host. At that point most of the underlying techniques for hosting multiple CKAN instances concurrently will be in place. Once we have that working and know what clients want, we can look at going further and speccing up a multisite solution off a single DB, rather than the multi-instance solution proposed here.

Item 1 seems fine (what is difference from current extension mechanism?)

Item 2: concerns here. What about list views? What about editing 'permissions'? I also think getting rid of System object isn't really a benefit (if anything may be a cost).

Item 3: feel this may be better as part of big domain model change (also gives us time to really dig into this -- this is an important requirement/conceptual issue).

Item 4: No objections but seems very minor gain for fairly significant migration work.

A PackageGroup is *just* a group of packages.

A UserGroup is both a group of users, and a thing affecting authorizations.

Perhaps PackageGroup and UserAuthorizationGroup? Or PackageGroup and AuthorizedUserGroup?

I was quite confused by all this at first.

I think I understand how the whole thing works pretty well now, and I still can't think of good names for the two concepts, although I can already feel the normal English meanings of the words changing to what I now know they are for.

We should be a little wary of this. Things that are even slightly difficult to understand end up being understood by very few people. Would any of us be prepared to sit an exam on exactly how UNIX file permissions work, even though we all use them?

IMO there is nothing to fix here.

from the web interface, russianfan can be added as an admin on warandpeace twice.

desired behaviour is that you can only add him once.

from the command line, you can only add him once, but if he's in there twice, you can't remove him because the command line bombs
desired behaviour is that he can be removed

from the shell, you can add him twice but can't remove him if he's been added twice.
if you try, it bombs.

The desired behaviour in all cases is that adding and removing are effective and idempotent in all three cases.

It appears that the WUI doesn't call these functions anyway. Left that as it is since we're planning to replace it.

The cli rights command doesn't appear to add the roles that it says it adds. Possibly because it's not doing the required commit? Reported this as a different bug.

 * We are parking this ticket until dictization is complete
 * We would prefer to see roles as asserted globally by default, with packages just storing exceptions.  E.g. If I am a "reader" globally, then I have "read-package" permission on all packages new and existing, unless otherwise asserted locally on a package.
 * Also w.r.t. algorithm above, consider repoze.what's model; "possible" is analagous to "has_permission".  See http://what.repoze.org/docs/1.0/Manual/Predicates/Builtin.html

                          <td class="newvalue">Wow, lots of solutions here, and not enough evidence of the problems encountered / difficult use cases.

I have tried here to extract what John and Seb might be suggesting is difficult with our current http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control system.

1. (Seb) It seems crazy to change the User-Object-Roles for every single package to 'lockdown' a CKAN instance. Instead of using Roles 'reader' &amp; 'editor' we start using Roles 'logged_in_user' and 'anon_user'. Then, with only changing a couple of lines of the Role-Action table for these Roles, you can give or remove permissions to edit / create packages, groups etc.

2. (John) Actions are being added all the time by migrations and extensions. I'm not sure what the problem is here - can someone explain? The separation of Users and the new Actions by adding the Role 'join' means the migration/extension can add existing Users with the new Actions. For example when we added the 'Group' protection object, logged in users could previously create groups, so it is natural to add this action to the 'editor' role. If you get rid of Roles, as John suggests, then you end up having to add as many Rights objects as users. And you might end up trying to infer new Rights on the basis of old Rights, rather than a role, which would be more natural. (Is the only reason to denormalise the UOR and RA tables the sake of ease of understanding? I would think we can explain the concept better now...!)

3. (John) This Group Hierarchy description sounds a bit like earlier incarnations of the DGU requirements. "or any of his groups group-children (but not user-children)" I'm not sure I understand the user-children bit, and I'm wary of any difficult-to-grasp concept. This modelling seems to take the UserGroup/User hierarchy model and use that as a hard-coded interpretation of the Authorized permission. In contrast, in DGU Evan split the Organisation Hierarchy model from the Authorization model. Each User has explicit permissions for each Organisation he is allowed to add/edit packages for. This helps for these two use cases we have to contend with: when a user is an admin for unrelated branches of the Organisation hierarchy, and when an Organisation is actually in two branches of the Organisation hierarchy. It also seems more generally flexible.

I would be very happy to write up a full, detailed proposal for the system before we implement anything, if only as a proper straw man to have debates around.

 Change name of AuthzGroup? to UserGroup? to reflect what it is for
I think this is completely covered off in #1477 Group refactor

 Get rid of Roles, and replace them with direct assignment of actions, even though there are many actions, and extensions can add arbitrary ones.
 Debatable whether we should cut the number of actions to correspond to the three roles defined by the base system.
This is not clear - please raise a ticket for this if still promising.
 Have a method of finding roles (or, in future, actions) relevant to a given protection object (e.g. FILE-UPLOAD(ER) not relevant to Packages)
These three points I've moved into a new ticket #1596 as it was getting lost rather in this one.

 Change UserGroups? so that they can have a hierarchical structure,
I think this is completely covered off in #1477 Group refactor

Conclusion: closing this ticket as all points are covered or moved into tickets elsewhere
