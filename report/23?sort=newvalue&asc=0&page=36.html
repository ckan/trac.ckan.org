I added this post discussion about attribution. Sam says that if we actually use the app itself (currently we're using the maps from it - but primarily by taking screenshots instead of actually integrating) then the attribution would automatically show.

In terms of ticket creating, I added this so people could see it and have a think about whether it's phase 3 or phase 4 (&amp; move where necc) &amp; whether you wanted more detail from me etc or whether it needed to be a more generic kind of ticket (i.e. 'need some low cost / low maintenance way to create backgrounds for demos').

In future, shall I email instead? Call on skype? IRC? before any tickets are created?

                          <td class="newvalue">@thejimmyg: It is neat simple solution.

You have suggested a proxy API:

''There will be a new API at ``/api/spreadsheet?callback=jsonpcallback&amp;url=``
''

There are two options:

1. Have public ckan data proxy as stand-alone service: I get package resource URL from CKAN and pass it to proxy

2. Have ckan data API (as ticket title suggests): If I am talking to CKAN, I am getting data from CKAN, I should not care about proxy or anything behind nor I should care about original data source - I care about resource data in a format that I can process (CSV/JSON).

For CKAN data API I would suggest something like:


{{{
/api/resource_data/RESOURCE_ID?...

}}}

or more human readable:


{{{
/api/resource_data/PACKAGE_NAME/RESOURCE_NUMBER?...

}}}

This will allow others to get only CKAN resources. Moreover, allowing to get only resource data (not any URL data) would allow us to pre-process resources in the future.

First version/implementation: pass each requested resource URL to your proxy service (external, not CKAN related), which determines file by file extension in URL, fail on unknown file or unprocessable file.

/api/resource_data/PACKAGE/RESOURCE?output=jsonp&amp;sheet=1...

would be redirected to (for example):

http://1.latest.jsonpdataproxy.appspot.com/?url=RESOURCE["URL"]&amp;sheet=1...


Second version/implementation: Determine file type in advance and pass to appropriate conversion service when requested

If you upload document on scribd or slideshare it gets processed in the background. This can be done in CKAN after any resource change. We do not need to download the file at the moment, however what can be done is:

1. try a converter by URL file extension
2. try a converter by MIME type (content-type header)
3. brute-force try all converters

No need to store copies of files, just store determined file type somewhere in the resource record (as mime type).

Also, it would be nice if any data conversion service would provide output in both - JSON/CSV. Therefore we would be able to have "Download CSV" link directly in CKAN web page for browsing users:

/api/resource_data/PACKAGE/RESOURCE?output=csv...

please do not try to change the meaning of tickets/add features or they will just get closed as won't fix.

featured datasets is nothing whatsoever to do with this ticket so adding it to the ticket just causes me to get upset / demotivated etc.  please do not do this.  It ruins my day.

Also comments like see sams design is of no value without a url in fact it has negative value.

:(

I have changed the priority of this ticket to account for this but next time i'll just close it.

can you use links to s031 for stuff like this as it is the testing serve and i can play with the data more - unless the error is specific to demo.ckan.org

-------------

with this issue it is actually wider than you suggest as I cannot edit the group that the dataset is in either.  We need to discuss this one as I don't know the best approach should groups select datasets or datasets groups or both - how do we remove datasets from groups - who can do this etc - maybe next week?

This is an issue with the related items schema - I'm not quite sure what all the rules should be 

eg does visulisation need image url? or is normal url ok?

Could you review the schema and ensure that we require/don't require the correct items.  If you provide the rules I can help do the schema if you want but I don't know them

cheers

the validation error seems correct to use 200

for the created the 303 seems ok but i'd just use pylons redirect myself

Actually I see you also want some text changes

please don't add unrelated discussions to tickets as it causes noise is disruptive and I just end up closing tickets as won't fix etc.

I have updated the text as it was assigned to me and so i am still keeping this closed as I did as requested. Can you an ira sort this out between yourselves and create a new ticket when you have agreement

Thanks

                          <td class="newvalue">@kindly I really don't get this but I may understand poorly. Google does not work by or-ing does it (as i add things to the search query I get *less* results not more ...).

It also makes it really hard to find stuff: as I add query terms to my query I get more stuff not less which makes for terrible finding of stuff - I appreciate that there is a scoring aspect but that seems secondary.

we actually need an extra state for full functionality can we create a new 'draft-complete' state as well?  does that need any additional magic?

this isn't really needed then!  there is no point doing work if we need to do it again editing resources is easy enough now anyway

I suggest we just close this ticket as a won't fix and #2705 as well while we're at it.

I'm also not happy about these being added to the phase 2 milestone when we are at the end of finishing it and these are not bugfixes or critical functionality

can you try to work out exactly how to cause this problem starting with `add a dataset` and let me know how you break things

tell me all the fields you filled in - also try to get it to happen using as little effort as possible  eg 
add dataset http://s031.okserver.org:2375/dataset/new

title = mooooo

click next:add data

resource = moo
format = csv

click `save &amp; add another`


click on resource just created in sidebar to edit

change format to `HTML,`  

click `Save &amp; add another`


etc


that all works fine for me what am i doing wrong?
thanks

also please try using a non sysadmin account

make a new ticket for any problems - Also for now we only care about major issues

I do not know how or where these are defined - he has package_update permissions from somewhere

It is much easier to work with tickets that only cover one thing - If something is found then the easiest thing is to add a new ticket.  If you feel it's related to another ticket then you can add that to the new ticket eg related to #1234

If tickets need combining it is easy for us devs to do it.  Basically adding something to a ticket is generally a bad thing.  Sometimes it's fair enough if something is missing for a new feature being reviewed etc - but even then a new ticket is generally not a problem.  Small tickets are nice to work on as we can close them quick etc.  The old [super] style tickets have been banned as they generally lead to owners becoming demotivated and unproductive.

It's always nice if you can find if a ticket already exists but I don't mind you opening a few duplicates if you can't find the ticket - for the demo you can probably just skim the tickets in the milestones as there aren't too many - but as you know I try to review them quite often.

Also please don't reopen really old tickets just add a new one If it's been closed in the last month or so then feel free to re-open if you're sure it's not just waiting for release - you can always check with the last owner of the ticket.

hope that makes sense

I'm not sure about this if some one is editing a resource moving to edit the dataset seems wrong -  a back to resource makes sense to me but not moving to the edit page

I'm just closing this

a) Because the ticket doesn't really mean anything what is `properly` also a link to some random website does not help.  The ticket should tell me exactly what is wanted not be some sort of treasure hunt.

b) This is major feature creep - we have agreed the tickets for phase 3 small things/bug fixes are fine but this possibly a massive thing.  For weird stuff like this maybe you should save them up for when we have a meet up.  You need to get buy-in from developers I need to have some sort of pride in what I do.

c) I don't think this is a good idea from a technical perspective - maybe if you create a meaningful ticket it may make more sense.

d) Also I'm not doing anything involving maps till we have proper attribution of the map we are using on the demo site because I have morals, I thought okfn did too but I'm not sure any more.

Sorry to have to do this but it is for my sanity.  As I have repeatedly said the tickets are really important as they are the basis of all the work that I do.  They need to be of a reasonable standard.

I'm happy to discuss things on irc/email if you are unsure about things.


If There are tickets that you are not sure about when they are wanted, then add them to phase 4 as they can then be ignored for now - anything added to phase 3 is a "this needs doing now" thing and as we have agreed exactly what we are doing in this phase (last week) then adding new features will likely get a negative reaction.  So if not sure add it to phase 4 - aron and I may do some phase 4 tickets if we feel they will be quick and easy.


As I've said small things like the breadcrumb is wrong on page xxx or bugfix tickets are fine as broken stuff needs fixing.  Sometimes it may not be clear how much work something will be or who the person who needs to fix it is - so just ask first.


The main problem with this ticket is that it is unclear what the ticket is about.

I have disabled the sort order of group datasets in phase 2 as it is totally broken - I'll re-add it in phase 3

Also the comment you made you added bug2 - text covers order by box -PLEASE DO NOT DO THIS - all it does is make the tickets really hard to deal with - if this becomes a habit I will close all such tickets as INVALID as it makes trac unusable for developers - THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT - cheers

if you make logic/auth/delete.py package_delete() return {'success': True} then it will give everyone the permission - useful for testing

we need to have this styled a little better when non-js user

maybe it needs a little thought so that the lightbox gets a snippet and the non-js user gets the snippet embedded in a page so consisten styling and looks like part of ckan

this is now in a snippet (jinja2 allows the selected="selected" more easily) needs some work still eg translation stuff and also maybe completely rewrite the snippet at some point.

Anyhow the functionality is there.  I added the button for no javascript working.

this is as good a place as anywhere to answer your question about the c.form thing.

a) some of this we are sort of stuck with.  datasets for example can be of different types and have different forms for different datasets. so they need to be rendered separately.  I have no idea why or how much this is used but it exists as an option to complicate everything, not much we can do about it.

b) I think trying to do pages as a single rendering is not going to be easy because of the way ckan has been created maybe we can change this over time.  One major issue for me is that ckan does lots of crazy stuff for some reasons but these reasons are not apparent from the code.  Maybe there is some documentation somewhere but I'm not convinced.

anyhow we should maybe close this ticket now.  You've added some stuff in the comment for me to do maybe that should be added as a new ticket?

tags what functionality do we want for this?  I can just reuse the facet_list snippet but then we have all sorts of interactivity.  Do we want this more a static list of tags (linked to somewhere but no add remove stuff)? seems more sensible I think

To clarify this a bit.

We want this so that a extension can create a new template say dataset/read.html but rather than rewriting the `core` template in ckan it can extend it in the same way as {% extends %}.

The main difference is that {% ckan_extends 'template.html' %} would `walk` the ckan template tree rather than the extensions template tree.

Is that what we are thinking?

This is possible via /ckan-admin/config

If we are doing this then we should just get it done asap.

I have to say I think it sucks as an idea as I know what a group and a publisher is in english and we have groups.  I'd like this  a wontfix

I've removed the breadcrumb and got it to eat flash messages as these tend to be repeated at least
for some actions - maybe the flash messages is overkill.


Anyhow I think it's good enough for phase 3 and we should either say it is done or move to phase 3

I think this would benefit from some design from Sam at some point and I quite like a graphic on an error page to make it a little pretty but not any rush

I've added a data summary

The data errors for empty fields are not happening due to our use of repoze.who for logins which is crap and doesn't provide feedback re loggin details so not possible without hacking repoze which i'm not doing.


Could you look at cleaning up the error summary we don't supply a field name (key) as not relevant it would be nice if we could hide the :  also removing the invalid fields message would be good to hide maybe add this as an option to the macro

I'm going to leave this open for the moment but not make the requested change as I need to think of the best way forward.  The flash message error is quite hard coded into the logic and I need to think of a nice solution.

also while we're at it I'd also really like

form.input(...., help_info=&lt;something&gt;) that would give a (?) icon with a :hover {display:block} div - that make sense?

I don't like auto submit as people may think (reasonably) that their changes are discarded.

We could catch all clicks and then ask the user if they've changed something but this feels a little crazy - better than the browser dialog.  hmmm

maybe we should discuss this ticket with the other backlog of undecided/unsure

personally I think we need to review the whole edit/view/delete logic as it feels real poor from my perspective - I need to edit something to delete it - that is a wtf imho

let's work out what we are doing before wasting energy on this

please note it is hidden in ckanext-demo also your `modal` think stops the link working - can you get it so that we open the href in a lightbox or somesuch.
