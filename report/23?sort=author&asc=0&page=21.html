desired behaviour is that he can be removed

from the shell, you can add him twice but can't remove him if he's been added twice.
if you try, it bombs.

The desired behaviour in all cases is that adding and removing are effective and idempotent in all three cases.

It appears that the WUI doesn't call these functions anyway. Left that as it is since we're planning to replace it.

The cli rights command doesn't appear to add the roles that it says it adds. Possibly because it's not doing the required commit? Reported this as a different bug.

A PackageGroup is *just* a group of packages.

A UserGroup is both a group of users, and a thing affecting authorizations.

Perhaps PackageGroup and UserAuthorizationGroup? Or PackageGroup and AuthorizedUserGroup?

I was quite confused by all this at first.

I think I understand how the whole thing works pretty well now, and I still can't think of good names for the two concepts, although I can already feel the normal English meanings of the words changing to what I now know they are for.

We should be a little wary of this. Things that are even slightly difficult to understand end up being understood by very few people. Would any of us be prepared to sit an exam on exactly how UNIX file permissions work, even though we all use them?

I agree that more information on the resource would be a good addition. It seems a bit of a different issue to just adding autocomplete though, with potentially far more changes to the codebase, so maybe it would be better discussed in a separate ticket/CREP. However, any new fields would presumably want to either be constrained or have an autocomplete and so can reuse the work done on this feature.

Changes in relation to Dataproxy / Dataapi:
* Currently only supports CSV files, but plans to add support for excel and google docs spreadsheets soon.
* Uses David Raznick's CSV parser instead of Brewery for parsing, handles messy CSV data better.

Changes in relation to old QA functionality:
* decoupled archiving (downloading) and QA process
* added a new 'process' command which parses downloaded files and adds them to a local webstore

Closing for now, any improvements/feature requests should be in tickets relating to either the QA functionality or the webstore.

Not checking for hash value in headers. This process will generally only run when a new resource is added or someone updates a URL, so we don't expect to be regularly downloading the same resource. 

We will need something along these lines if this is running as a regular cron job, but in that case the logic will be added to the cron job itself (probably a paster command).

&gt; packages, apart from via the Tags interface, and the search page and widget on the front-page are removed. (BTW Is this a 
&gt; useful thing to do? Without search, perhaps CKAN should simply not start?)

When discussing the ticket we agreed that we should allow ckan to start without search. It is possible that people simply want to list/view information without searching for it and we decided not to prevent them from doing so.

&gt; I believe the problem pudo is referring to is temporary periods when the SOLR server is slow/overloaded/down. During this 
&gt; time pudo and I get exception emails saying connection failed for request.

Ok, other options then:

 * if an error occurs during search, return 0 results
 * if an error occurs during search, redirect to a generic 'search is unavailable' page
 * if an error occurs during search, retry the query a certain number of times before giving up and doing one of the above.

What do you suggest?

Yes it is easy to get a list of IDs from Solr so I'll have a look at that command and make sure that it works. I think a case could be made for not allowing a package to be added if it cannot be indexed however, and making the user simply retry the request.

&gt; tally with what you mentioned in the last comment or is what's there better?

This sounds good to me, definitely better than what is currently there.

&gt; Thanks for the info on the queue and ckanext-solr. It sounds like this isn't deployed successfully anywhere (or does pudo
&gt; know if it is?).

I'm not actually sure if the queue works or not, but if it does I'll have to write some tests for it before we could add it to core. A working queue system would be useful generally however, as there are other things that it would be useful for (such as QA), but yes, going forward the Solr extension should really be deprecated.

                          <td class="newvalue">This ticket again brought up the issue of a need for inversion of control for writing to CKAN templates (main templates should really ask extensions for data or provide hooks rather than having extensions overwrite sections using genshi/jquery). Have decided to defer this issue for now, as it will be looked at when looking at making our whole extension system more robust early next year.

Related point:

 * We should provide a dashboard area (again via interfaces/hooks) that groups together report data from related extensions. So stats and googleanalytics info should be available from a similar area / url. This is also deferred until the extension overhaul/refactor.


Other outstanding issues:

 * Location / style of download count can be improved
 * Download count should be shown on resource pages

These should be looked at by whoever takes over frontend design.
