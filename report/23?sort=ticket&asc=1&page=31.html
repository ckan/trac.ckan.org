                          <td class="newvalue">Many strings have been fixed (and committed on master). Still to go:

When uploading a file:

- The "Browse..." button. This comes from the user's browser?

- Hangs when I try to upload a file, so the rest of this UI is unchecked.

The licenses on the dataset add, edit and view pages, "License Not Specified" etc.

Dataset state on dataset view page, e.g. "active".

When adding or editing resources:

- The resource types (Data File, etc.) The strings seem to come from resource.resource_type.

- "You can use Markdown formatting here", "Should a DataStore table and Data API be enabled for this resource?", "Dates are in ISO Format — eg. 2012-12-25 or 2010-05-31T14:30". I can't get strings with hyperlinks in them to translate here.

Dataset view page:

- License not specified.

Dataset search page:

- "Tags", "Res_format" and "Groups" in the sidebar. Leaving because this code has been refactored on feature-1821-multilingual-extension. Fix after that branch has been merged.

Dataset view page:

- The resource types, e.g. "plain text".
- The field names under additional information: cache_last_updated etc.

Dataset history view: timestamps not localised.

Login page:

- "Login failed. Bad username or password. (Or if using OpenID, it hasn't been associated with a user account.)" This string is marked for translation but I can't seem to get translations to work for flash messages. Also "Sean Hammond is now logged in" flash message.

Register page:

- "Missing value" in error message when you try to register and don't give an email. The string seems to come from formencode. stdtrans() not working?

User view page:

- Activity streams strings. Activity streams genshi function needs a little refactoring to be i18n-friendly.

Users page:
- "less than 1 month". This string comes from Pylons' time_ago_in_words() function which doesn't appear to support i18n.

New auth group (and edit auth group) page:

- "Unique identifier for group. 2+ chars, lowercase, using only 'a-z0-9' and '-_'". This string is marked for translation but for some reason it isn't working.

- "Name: Please enter a value" (in an error msg)

- "User name". The string comes from class FormBuilder?

Also, need to check that all tooltips are translated!

please do not try to change the meaning of tickets/add features or they will just get closed as won't fix.

featured datasets is nothing whatsoever to do with this ticket so adding it to the ticket just causes me to get upset / demotivated etc.  please do not do this.  It ruins my day.

Also comments like see sams design is of no value without a url in fact it has negative value.

:(

I have changed the priority of this ticket to account for this but next time i'll just close it.

{{{
curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/3/action/package_search?q=police
}}}

or, for cases where a more complex data_dict is required, the data_dict can be parsed as a json-encoded dict in a single url-parameter called ``data_dict``, ie:

{{{
curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/3/action/package_search?data_dict={'q':'police'}
}}}

As part of this ticket:

 - I noticed that all module-public members of the action modules were being loaded as actions (including functions imported from other modules).  So I've cleared up the  action modules to prevent this.

 - I've cleaned up the action modules to use ``get_or_bust()`` when accessing a passed in data_dict outside before it's been validated by a schema.  This provides better error messages for clients.

 - provided a decorator, ``@side_effect_free``, for users implementing their own actions through the IActions interface to be able to expose their custom/overridden actions as a GET request through the action API.

Another option is to have the data_dict json-encoded in the GET request's body.  This is possible, but

1) Although permissable, it's not, as I understand it, conventional to have a GET request's body form the options of the request.

2) Caching proxies won't inspect the body of the request, only the URL.

If things are hard to find we need to change our relevancy first.  So if you have examples of where you think the scoring is wrong then please make a ticket for that.

Google, I imagine, just has a cutoff of anything under a certain score not being shown.  We could do that as well but it would take some working out what we wanted that score to be.

Full "And" queries also limit any accidental discovery, especially of rare terms.  If you do not get your search exactly correct then you get nothing, which is bad.

Obviously you can still AND things or +things.

The correct solution to this is adding a minimum match parameter which is a middle ground. eg you can say that you want to match over half of the terms.  "thing1 thing2 thing3 thing3"  means you have to match at least 2. There are many options described here. http://wiki.apache.org/solr/DisMaxQParserPlugin.   You can change this in an extension if you want it just requries adding an mm field to the before_search in the Ipackage controller.  I do not personally think we should change it as default.

I am closing it as wont fix as its trivial to change and is a philosophical difference not a technical one.

This returns 15 datasets yet only one of them has any mention of thatchers (the first one!). (The others are there because they match wages). This isn't what I expect. I expect *only* to see datasets that match *both* terms ...

Google don't OR the results, they have an explicit operator for ORing query terms and default to ensuring that all terms are present (in one form or another) in the documents.  I understand the argument about cut-offs and relevancy scores, but for a large search engine they have the benefit of scale both in resource and documents. I spent 6 months of my life tweaking weightings for n-dimensional vector space search, I don't think it is likely to be a number we can, or will find by accident.

Given that Marcus also got confused by the current behaviour I think we should either:

a) Make it configurable
b) Just change it to what has been asked for

Don't care which.

 * Related is a pretty terrible name in the UI - much better to have it called Apps, Ideas etc (perhaps title tag could even give more details e.g. "Apps, Ideas, Visualization and other material related to this dataset") -- btw i thought this was in #2332 but realize it wasn't (apologies for that!)
 * Documentation, documentation, documentation - AFAICT I can't see anything in v1.7 or master docs. I imagine this would be a short section like http://docs.ckan.org/en/ckan-1.7/commenting.html (and probably coming right after that in the ToC) which says
  * What it does
  * How to enable (and perhaps includes a nice-screenshot!)
  * How to customize (e.g. can one customize the list of options of things one can create (e.g. can I set it to just be app and idea or ...)
  * Also liase with Mark W re a blog post about this from the user perspective (a screenshot walkthrough ...)
 * Clearly mark this old extension as deprecated from v1.7 forward: https://github.com/okfn/ckanext-apps (I just met someone last week who was working on integrating this and had no idea it was replaced by something better in v1.7)
