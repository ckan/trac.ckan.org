=============

This repository contains a backup of CKAN's Trac issue tracker as it existed in
22/Jan/2014. This serves only for historical purposes, as we're using GitHub
Issues now.

It was created by running our Trac instance in http://localhost and using:

```
wget -q --mirror --no-parent -p --adjust-extension -e robots=off --base=./ -k -P ./ http://localhost
```
