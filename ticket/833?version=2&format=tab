833	Administrative dashboard extension	rgrp		"Create an admin dashboard as /admin/ allowing for admin operations and overview.

Possible features:
  * Purge revisions (or sets of revisions)
  * Purge objects
  * Set roles for users
    * Put system into particular modes e.g. wiki mode (anyone can add, edit packages by default), data portal (only sysadmins or members of a special Editor group can create and edit packages)
  * Overview of activity

Currently have an admin section using the formalchemy admin controller to provide basic editing of model objects. This can still be used but located at /admin/model/.
