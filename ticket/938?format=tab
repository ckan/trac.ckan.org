938	Message flashing / notification in WUI	rgrp	pudo	"Good user interfaces provide feedback to users. We should provide more feedback about the success / failure of actions using message flashing (see http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/patterns/flashing/).

We already do some of this (slightly poorly), e.g. on adding an authorization the app says: ""X authorization added"".

== Implementation ==

 * Standardize this process and add section to html for this purpose.
 * Already done in other OKFN apps e.g. yourtopia.net, wheredoesmymoneygo and commentonit
 * Testing: suggest keeping this very simple

== Estimate ==

 * Cost: 0.5h (html etc) + 1h to do some integration
