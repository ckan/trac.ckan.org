1424	Openness notice should be clearer	dread		"ckan-discuss discussion suggests changes to the 'openness' indicator
( http://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/ckan-discuss/2011-October/001786.html )

Dataset view page:
 * If there is an explicit but non-OKD compliant license, such as CC-BY-NC, then this should be stated explicitly, perhaps: “This dataset is Not Open. License: Creative Commons Attribution Noncommerical. This is not an open license as it does not meet the Open Knowledge Definition.”
 * If the license is marked as “Other::License Not Specified”, then this should be stated explicitly, perhaps:
 “This dataset is Not Open. It is published without an explicit license, the publisher reserves all rights to the dataset.”
 * 3. If the license field was left empty by the contributor of the Data Hub record, then again this should be stated explicitly, perhaps: “This dataset is Not Open. The license of this dataset is unknown or unspecified. Start an enquiry on IsItOpenData »
 * There is a bug so that non-open licenses doesn't have an openness notice.
 * If downloadable resources are not available, this should not affect 'openness' - check this has been removed."	enhancement	new	minor	ckan-backlog	ckan			richard@…	ckan	none
