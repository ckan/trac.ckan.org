1593	[super] Create feeds from search results	amercader	icmurray	"Recent changes (see #191 and #1498) have made really easy to get search results ordered chronologically, and creating RSS or Atom feeds from them is relatively easy.

Feeds are extremely popular and there are several tools for consuming them, so it would be a great way to allow users to follow datasets related with their topics of interest.

Apart from the general feed with changes on the whole instance, other different ""pre-set"" feed endpoints could be implemented. The most obvious choices for custom feeds could be groups and tags:
{{{
http://<ckan_server>/feed/group/{id}.{format:rss|atom}
http://<ckan_server>/feed/tag/{id}.{format:rss|atom}
}}}

These could be shown on the group/tag page, both on the <head> section, so browsers can autodiscover them, and on the UI, with a message like ""Subscribe to this group/tag"".

Another powerful option is to have a custom feed builder that accepts the same parameters as the search page, so users can subscribe to whatever query they are interested on

{{{
http://<ckan_server>/feed/custom.{format:rss|atom}?res_format=api%2Fsparql
http://<ckan_server>/feed/custom.{format:rss|atom}?q=tags:animal*
}}}

On this case a message ""Subscribe to these search results"" would appear.

Note that a lot of work on this front needs to be done for the IATI registry project (see #1590)


Other tickets related:
 * #1592: metadata_modified and metadata_created are not included in the search results, so an extra query for each package is needed right now.
