1090	Visitor can't create packages on new CKAN install	dread	dread	"Default visitor roles in default config is reader, not anon_editor. 

Problem caused by changes in #1066 (released in 1.3.3)

New installs will be affected, although simple to just increase permissions when the installer realises a visitor can't create packages.

The solution to the config getting out of sync with the code like this is to not have the default_roles in the config - refer to the code in the configuration instructions."	defect	closed	minor	ckan-v1.4-sprint-6	ckan	fixed			ckan	none
