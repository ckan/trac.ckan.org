1386,Disallow account creation via openid,rgrp,rgrp,"Superticket: #1343

Creation of accounts from OpenID causes large number of problems:
 * No guarantee of other profile info
 * Poor username (just from openid)

We therefore will:

 1. Require creation of user account via register (no auto-creation of accounts via openid)
  * sidebar of register page should point to login page rather than openid signin
 
 2. Permit association of an openid with an account ...
  * How: paste in your openid url (requires change to edit form to have this)
    * won't work for google with their weird openid urls
  * [future] Nicer way is to have login via openid while logged in (which association then happening in background)

 3. Migration (for 1+2):
  * (?) Generate decent usernames for all existing accounts
  * As this is nontrivial suggest instead we allow editing of usernames (by account owner and sysadmins). This is useful in its own right and is a reasonable 80/20 solution.
    * This does present the problem of re-associating commits with the new username. Best solution to this would be to switch revisions to point to userid rather than username.

 4. [optional] Change display_name to always be username
  * Change My Account to Username at top right of all pages (once we know
    usernames are short ...)
    * could do this straight away by truncating long usernames (e.g. truncate
      at 20 chars ...)
    * Also should we lose the icon?
