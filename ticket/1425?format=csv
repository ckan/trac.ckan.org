1425,Dataset delete button,dread,zephod,"From Jonathan gray: 

At the moment to delete a package you have to go to 'state' and change from 'active' to 'deleted'.

For me this was not very obvious, and someone recently wrote to me about this too.

Its a small issue - but unless you know what 'state: active' refers to, its not obvious what this means, nor that this is where to go if you want to delete a package.

From UI perspective this could be replaced by either a trash can or some text that says 'delete', perhaps with some prompt that explains what happens when you delete a package - explaining that non-admins won't be able to see it, and how you purge, etc.
