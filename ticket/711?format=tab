711	Packages shall support both UK government and location information with a common set of attributes	johnbywater	thejimmyg	"Previously, a package type attribute was intended to distinguish between package data that came from government depts. and publishers location information (GEMINI). Now there is an intention use a common set of attributes to support data from either source.

Hence, there currently a v.3 of the government attributes, a document about extracting the attributes from Gemini document using XPath, and a comparison documents mapping between governemtn attributes and Gemini attributes.

That means there are potentially four different list of attributes. I'm not sure how to go about reviewing the lists and converging any differences.

But we do want to end up with a list of names, a description of their purpose, and then perhaps the XPath which would reveal the value from a Gemini doc?"	requirement	closed	minor	ckan-v1.3	uklii	fixed
