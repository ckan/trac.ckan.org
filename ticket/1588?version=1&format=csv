1588,QA - Give SPARQL endpoints a 4 star rating,johnglover,johnglover,"Super: #1594

From Richard Cyganiak on the CKAN Discuss list:

Besides considering the media type of resources, it would also make sense to check for the presence of a SPARQL endpoint. SPARQL endpoints are recorded for more than 300 datasets on the Data Hub using the pseudo-type ""api/sparql"". A few more are recorded with the format ""SPARQL"". I suggest that datasets with such resources should also be considered for the fourth star.",enhancement,new,major,ckan-v1.6,ckan,,qa,,ckan,none
