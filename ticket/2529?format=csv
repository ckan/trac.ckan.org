2529,DataHub (or CKAN) widgets,rgrp,,"Simple widgets in pure JS. For example:

 * Count of datasets in a group (could generalise to a query but not sure how useful that is ...)
 * Embeddable list of top X (5) datasets for a given query
 * Embeddable list of *my* datasets

Either these live at: {site}/widgets and we have some kind of generator (form where I choose my group, or my query).

Or: we have this attached to areas of site where relevant.

Can combine the 2 so that the latter links to the former. Think first will be easier to do and possibly more useful long-term (e.g. can just link people to that page).
