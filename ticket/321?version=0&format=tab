321	Delegate authentication to Drupal	johnbywater	johnbywater	"When CKAN is included in a Drupal front-end, CKAN edit pages are used in a slave-mode, such that authentication is delegated to the Drupal front-end user model.

The Drupal front-end shall provide:

1. Login page - fixed location, can authenticate users, on successful  authentication sets auth cookie and redirects to HTTP_REFERER.

2. Access control resource - fixed location, can authorise users, on receipt of valid auth cookie return message listing account details and permitted actions.

3. Access denied page - fixed location, static resource, gently 
indicates what has happened, and how to ask for permission.
