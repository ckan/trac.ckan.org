962,Improvements to data preview extension,rgrp,rgrp,"Basic implementation done (and deployed):

https://bitbucket.org/okfn/ckanext-datapreview

However plenty to improve, e.g.

 * Support more formats (use external systems for preview?)
  * json (!)
  * html (trivial!)
  * sparql
  * ...
 * Do not display preview if no preview

Also suggest reworking to use external services rather than doing preview 'in house' (doing in house places heavy reliance on data proxy service and on converting data to a standard format).",enhancement,closed,critical,ckan-v1.4-sprint-5,ckan,fixed,extension,,ckan,none
