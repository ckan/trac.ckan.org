303	Package history & feed to show changes to tags, extras and resources	dread	johnbywater	"Currently a package's history page (/package/history/xyz) and related feed only shows changes to the core package i.e. ones which create a PackageResource. This doesn't include changes to tags, extras and resources. These need to be added.

There is the complication that the 'diff' function doesn't currently work beyond PackageResource. Unless this is quick and simple to fix, I suggest we let the diff remain slightly broken for now.

Rufus suggests alongside the existing methods:
{{{
pkg.all_revisions()
pkg.diff()
}}}
we have ones which also include the related objects (tags, extras, resources):
{{{
pkg.all_revisions_full()
pkg.diff_full()
}}}
You could have a function which returned these related objects. Ideas:
{{{
revobjlist = [ self, resources, extras ]
list of tuples: (revobj, changed_revobjs)
list of tuples: (revobj, {objtype: [changed_revobjs]})
tuple: (rev1, {Package: [ object_id, object_id], PackageTag: [object_id, object_id2] ...}
}}}"	defect	new	awaiting triage	v1.0	ckan
