    <title>CKAN: Ticket #2886: Configurable related items</title>
    <link>http://localhost/ticket/2886</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;
Related items (Apps &amp;amp; Ideas) have a collection of types, which are currently fixed.  Some of these types are ambiguous, such as ideas in that they may not have a link - and if they do it is likely to be to a blog post - another existing type.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Whilst the URL is required, and we think this should stay required, we should also allow users to change the types found in Apps &amp;amp; Ideas to a shortened list that suits their requirements.
&lt;/p&gt;
