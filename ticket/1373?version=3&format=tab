1373	home page view does not react to logging in / out	shevski		"Either: thedatahub.org does not display 'add a dataset' top navigation link or the 'create dataset' main central link to logged in user - instead showing 'sign up' link in the central box. It does however display the 'my account' and 'logout' link in the top right correctly.

Navigating to another part of the site (e.g. search or about or my account) does bring the 'add a dataset' navigation link back and the functionality works.

Works fine on test.ckan.net so only on thedatahub.

Not obviously a caching problem, since I did try clearing cache...

OR: it displays as if you're logged in even when you log out. The links doesn't work and prompt you to log in though."	defect	assigned	major	ckan-sprint-2011-11-07	ckan				ckan	none
