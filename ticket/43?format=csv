43,Generic Attributes for Packages,rgrp,rgrp,"= As A =

= I Want To =

Add arbitrary named attributes to packages (an attribute being a name, type, value triple).

= Details =

  * We will do this using a dedicated (versioned) table associated to Package
  * Do we allow multiple attributes of the same name?
    * For the present: No (since we will key by attribute name)
    * Could allow for single attribute but with multiple values using json list ...
  * What types do we allow or do we just rely on JSON to take care of this?

= Questions (Original) =

  * How complex is this to implement?
  * What would an arbitrary user be able to edit? Possibilities:
    1. 'create new attribute' and setting the value (so name and type would be chosen from predefined list).
    2. 'create', setting of name and value (but not type -- type already set in predefined list)
  * Could just use (machine) tags -- though this could be seen as a bit of a hack.
  * Would solve having to create special file/url attributes (though I think that perhaps file stuff is important enough to merit first class support in the domain model -- though, that said, since one won't want to have a file limit adding unlimited file support is very similar to unlimited attributes of arbitrary type).",enhancement,closed,critical,v0.10,ckan,fixed,,,,
