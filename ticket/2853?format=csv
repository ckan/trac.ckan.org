2853,unclear error message in refreshing harvest source,shevski,toby,"Tried to refresh the datagm harvest source to get error message:

""An error occurred: [There already is an unrun job for this source]""

This is unclear and not sure why it created an error. We should have something informative such as ""A harvest has already been scheduled for this source""

Do we have a date/time for when this has been scheduled that we can display?",enhancement,closed,awaiting triage,demo phase 3,ckan,fixed,demo-theme,amercader,ckan,none
