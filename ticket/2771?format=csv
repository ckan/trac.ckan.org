The IDatasetForm example should use tag vocabularies (two birds with one stone)

The IDatasetForm and IGroupForm docs are not very good (and are somewhat spread around different doc chapters), fix them up, and reference the new working examples.

Tab Vocabularies docs should reference IDatasetForm example.

When using convert_to/from_extras() you have to remove any free extras from the form or it won't work, this needs to be documented (in the docstring maybe)

There have been recent changes to the schemas that IDatasetForm and IGroupForm use, make sure the docs are up to date.",enhancement,new,awaiting triage,ckan-v1.8,ckan,,docs,,ckan,none
