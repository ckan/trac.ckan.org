1172	Remove all try: except: blocks that don't re-raise the original exception	thejimmyg	dread	The current codebase has one or two try: except; blocks that don't catch specific exceptions. Under no circumstances should any broad try: except: blocks be allowed unless the exceptions they catch are immediately re-raised. Uncaught exceptions are wasting us quite a lot of time when trying to track down problems.	defect	closed	major	ckan-sprint-2011-10-28	ckan	fixed			ckan	none
