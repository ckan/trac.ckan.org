If so, the browser does indeed just download the file.

This is notable in the context of most hosted file services (including Google Storage) which will deliberately serve a MIME type of `application/x-some-junk-here` in order to force a download."	defect	closed	awaiting triage	ckan-sprint-2011-10-28	ckan	fixed			ckan	none
