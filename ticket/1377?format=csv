1377,Ckan admin repair,zephod,zephod,"Integrating ckanext-admin into core has thrown up a number of problems:
  * Look & feel does not match the rest of the site
  * Tests are not passing
  * On the trash page, clicking 'undelete' triggers a purge
  * Using the purge functionality is dangerous; deleting and purging the latest revision will corrupt a dataset (& several corrupt datasets have been found on thedatahub.org)
  * Trash page can contain nested form tags in certain cases (breaking test harness & form redirection)
