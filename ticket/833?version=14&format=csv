=== Notes ===

Here's putting into restricted mode (plus creating a dedicated authz group so that others can admin sysadmin simply through that group):

{{{
# first remove permissions from roles
# this is hacky but have to do it because we hardcode assignment of 
# role permissions on package on package create (see model/authz.py)
paster roles deny editor edit
paster roles deny editor create-authorization-group
paster roles deny editor create-group
paster roles deny editor create-package
paster roles deny reader create-package
# make superuser group
# create authz group administrators / Administrators (if not exists)
paster rights make agroup:administrators admin system
