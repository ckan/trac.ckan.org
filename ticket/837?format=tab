837	CKAN integration with freebase gridworks / google refine	rgrp		"Thread: http://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/ckan-discuss/2010-November/000718.html

=== Scenario 1 ===

 1. User installs Refine and CKAN extension for refine
 2. On booting refine and asked to load data they can choose from any data package on CKAN.net (or any other CKAN instance)
 3. They edit the dataset on Refine
 4. On save (or perhaps as a separate option) they are prompted as to whether they wish  to sync the dataset back to CKAN (either as a new package or as a new resource on the existing package)

NB: for the dataset sync back some form of ""CKAN"" storage would be
required (we already have storage.ckan.net running but a closer
integration would be required)

=== Scenario 2 ===

 1. User visits a package on CKAN.net (or another CKAN instance)
 2. There is a button on the page ""View and edit this dataset in Google Refine""
 3. Click button -- ask them if they have Google refine installed
  * Yes: instructions for loading dataset into refine
  * No: load dataset in hosted version of google refine (we could run this)
 4. User edits dataset and hits save. As in previous scenario they are prompted to sync the dataset."	enhancement	new	awaiting triage	ckan-backlog	ckan				ckan	none
