2234,Write a CKAN extension for pulling items from RSS/Atom feeds into CKAN templates,seanh,,"You configure the extension with some RSS and/or Atom feeds, it automatically reads items from these feeds and makes them available in the template context, you write a custom template to e.g. display 'news' items from a Wordpress blog on your front page.

This extension might be simpler and less fragile than ckanext-wordpresser, and also more generally useful.

Details

- Mark Pilgrim's Universal Feed Parser might be useful for reading the feeds

- Feed items should probably be cached somewhere


Suggested 

- The news item 'widget' should be wrapped in a known class so that it can be styled easily regardless of the format of any HTML entry.

- For non-HTML formatted items (Atom should tell you the content type of the entry) maybe we should have a template for rendering each item along with any enclosures that it might reference

- Caching is pretty crucial and should probably obey the ttl of the feed.
