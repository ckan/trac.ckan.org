    <title>CKAN: Ticket #2859: Fix the build</title>
    <link>http://localhost/ticket/2859</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;
The requires files have been removed.  These were required by buildkit.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We've lost the information regarding which packages were already in ubuntu repos, which conflicted and which were missing.  But perhaps we can just package everything up.
&lt;/p&gt;
