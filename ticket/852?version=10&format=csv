852,[super] Dataset upload and archiving,wwaites,rgrp,"3 (4) use cases: (With and without access to auth keys.)

 1. upload form on ckan (by default local system has auth key for storage)
 2. datapkg upload (client) (by default without key) (plumbing done)
 3. background job archiving downloads (by queue client) 

Most important are:

1. Upload form on ckan.net (with access to keys)
2. API for getting credentials for upload from ckan.net api (without access to keys).

Aside: Once 2 was done we could deprecate storage.ckan.net
