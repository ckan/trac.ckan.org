1077,Move to simpler vdm system,rgrp,kindly,"== Option 1: 'Changeset' Model ==

See ticket:1135 for vdm ticket. This would involve a) moving to changeset in vdm b) doing the migration in ckan to support this.

Have developed a new ""changeset"" based model for revisioning in vdm. 


=== Implementation ===

 * The main challenge with this change is schema and data migration

Every revisioned object has a revision_id and revision attribute.

Approximate algorithm:

{{{
Revision -> Changeset

for revtype in [PackageRevision, ...]:
    for pkgrev in package_revision:
        changeset = lookupchangeset(package_revision)
        ChangeObject(cset, (table, id), dictize(pkgrev))
}}}

Question:
   * does pkg include tags attributes or not? or we have to dictize, pkgrev, pkg2tagrev, and tag. Probably the latter.

== Option 2: Simplify Revision Object Model ==

Just use a simpler vdm, see ticket:1136 (move to !SessionExtension) and ticket:1137 (remove need for statefulness in vdm).

== Discussion ==

Advantage of Option 1 versus 2:

 * Easier support for pending state and similar behaviour
 * No need to introduce new tables (and hence migrations) when making something revisioned (or not).

=== Disadvantages ===

 * Migration is required
 * More difficult to query revision history.
  * Could be addressed by having !ChangeObject have separate cols for table name and id but would likely be more difficult.
 * Performance (?)
  * Have one big !ChangeObject table to query when looking at changed objects rather than many revision tables.
   * Not sure this is a biggie as even with Revision model biggest revision object tables are probably on the order of the !ChangeObject table

== Conclusion ==

Implement Option 2 and leave Option 1 for present.

Option 1 includes Option 2 so it seems that that is required in either case (so we may as well with Option 2).

Option 1 requires significant effort (esp migration) so leave for present and then review the situation at some later date.",enhancement,new,awaiting triage,ckan-backlog,ckan,,,,ckan,none
