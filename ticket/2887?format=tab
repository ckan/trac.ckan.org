    <h1 class=""page_heading"">Welcome to ${g.site_title}!</h1>

which means that just ""Welcome to"" ends up in the ckan.po files for
translation. This makes the phrase untranslatable in languages that have a different word ordering than English where the site title needs to be somewhere other than at the end of the sentence."	defect	new	major	ckan-v1.8.1	ckan		i18n		ckan	none
