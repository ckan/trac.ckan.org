1423	Edit resources suggestions	markbrough		"* Description vs Name - Edit Resources view is showing the name of the package rather than the description, and a lot (all?) of the packages before the upgrade don't have names, so might be good to swap this round again, e.g.: http://thedatahub.org/dataset/edit/iati-registry

* Moving resources - Moving them up or down the list used to be quite useful if you had a lot of resources that you might want to leave on the resources page, but only one or two that were actually current and that you wanted to draw attention to. This doesn't exist any more on CKAN but I think it would be good to add it back in."	enhancement	new	awaiting triage	ckan-v1.5	ckan				ckan	none
