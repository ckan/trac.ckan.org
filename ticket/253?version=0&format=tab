253	Package relationships	dread	rgrp	"New domain object: PackageRelationship (revisioned)

Attributes:
  * src (Package reference)
  * dest (Package reference)
  * type (string)
  * comment

Relationship types:
is_dependent_on (is_dependency_of)
is_derived_from (has_derivation)
is_child_of (is_parent_of)

Relationship type is stored using an inherited mapped object, as given in the first column. The reverse relationship (bracketed) is given just for display purposes only.

WUI:
  * View: show both sides of the relationship (but think carefully -- e.g. a given package may have *many* dependents ...)
  * Editable as part of package or separately? (e.g. like authz)
  * Do we normalize to only one type name of the pair?
  * Do we allow create of relationship from both ends (e.g. only from dependency to dependent or either way?)
  
API:
  * Appear in package listing Example: 'relationships': [{'is_dependency_of':'osm', comments:'Since version 0.2'}, {'is_parent_of':'bobs_maps'}]
  * No need for write access to be provided API for the moment.
