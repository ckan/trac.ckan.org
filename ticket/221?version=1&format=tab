221	UI Review - Package edit	dread	rgrp	"Package edit page [/package/edit/mypackagename]
  * Ability to add the package to groups on this page.
  * Fields could be grouped.
  * Inconsistent capitalisation (Url -> URL).
  * Tag editor YUI script appears to break occasionally.
  * Perhaps move to two column forms to save vertical space?
  * Notes field to monospace?
  * Extras fields need some jQuery love -- shouldn't have a fixed number available.
  * Typography is a bit of a mess.
