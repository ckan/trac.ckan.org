1462,Multi-Instance CKAN Solr Search Issues,thejimmyg,amercader,"With the 1.5 package release, CKAN instances over-write each other's indexes. Adria has a fix.

I'd like to see a new CKAN 1.5.1 release with the Solr changes merged and the Solr site ID set up as part of the install ckan.site_id = dgu-os.okfn.org. I'd also like the ability to search on ID and to have the ID directly visible on the package page.

We need to decide how to do this upgrade without affecting existing CKAN solr indexes.",defect,closed,minor,ckan-sprint-2011-12-19,ckan,fixed,,amercader,ckan,none
