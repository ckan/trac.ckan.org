368	500 Server error when creating package	anonymous		"
I've just started writing the importer from cap.open.org.nz and was running an initial import of just the package name and titles. The packages were created however I received a 500 error in response:

The server should not respond with a 500 error if the package was created. "	defect	closed	awaiting triage		ckan	wontfix
