2707,Tidy up additional info boxes on dataset and resource pages,shevski,toby,"This currently looks terrible. Some simple things we should do to improve this.

 * Localise and captitalise known (non custom) keys into human titles. eg. ""size"", ""created_at"", ""mime_type"".
 * Apply units to values of known keys where possible eg. ""size in appropiate units""
 * Convert dates into a more human friendly format. We can avoid localisation hell by using an ISO format like YYYY/MM/DD hh:mm:ss which is still better than ISO8061
 * Move the non user fields to the top of the table.
