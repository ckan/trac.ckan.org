331	Timezone of CKAN timestamps should be configurable	rgrp		"Revisions are timestamped using the server's clock, which may not relate to the expected timezone for the site. e.g. the Norway site has a server on GMT. No timezone info is displayed either.

Would like to set timezone for a CKAN instance to use in rendering revision timestamps. For example, use CET or EST timezone."	enhancement	new	awaiting triage		ckan
