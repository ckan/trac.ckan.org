1775,Enable adding many tags at once to controlled vocabularies via API,seanh,seanh,"We already have API calls for adding one tag or removing one tag at a time to/from a vocab. Want more convenient ways to add or remove many in one call, or just pass in a list of tags to completely replace a vocab's current list.

- Add tags_create() function that calls the existing tag_create() many times?
- Also tags_delete()?
- Or just let tag_create() and tag_delete() accept a list?
- Add tags argument to vocabulary_update() to pass in a list of tags to replace the vocab's current tags? (But it should still be possible to simply rename a vocab without changing its tags and without having to pass in the tag list.)",enhancement,new,awaiting triage,current-ckan-sprint-2012-02-20,ecportal,,taxonomies [0.5d],,ckan,none
