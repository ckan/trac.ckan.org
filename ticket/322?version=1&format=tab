322	Interface for Notification Service	dread	dread	"=== Use cases ===
 * Registration
 * Deregistration
 * Configuration of port in pylons config

=== Design ===
 * Default port: 5672 (standard for AMQP)
 * Exchange name: 'ckan'
 * Exchange type: topic exchange (most flexible)
 * Routing keys: (see below)

=== Routing detail ===
Routing key format: ""OBJ_TYPE.OBJ_ID.CHANGE_TYPE""
(NB tags should be identified by their name, not ID)

Example routing keys
 * 'package.238bc-704a87-928374.new' - New package created with ID '238bc-704a87-928374'
 * 'group.4234-ab98203-fe324.edited' - Group '4234-ab98203-fe324' edited
 * 'tag.704a8-2f38bc-928374.' - New package created with ID '238bc-704a87-928374'

Example queue bindings that clients may use: 
 * * - no filtering - client receives all notifications
 * package.* - only changes to packages
 * package.238bc-704a87-928374.* - only changes to a particular package
 * package.#.new - only packages creations

=== Versioning ===
Since message payloads will be tied into the REST Entities, it makes sense to join up with the REST versioning. This could be achieved by providing new exchanges called 'ckan-1.1' perhaps?
