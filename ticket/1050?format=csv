1050,Authz lib improvement and refactor of ckan/lib/authztool.py,johnlawrenceaspden,thejimmyg,"Refactor ckan/lib/authztool.py so that the relevant methods are independent of the command line interface.

The extracted methods should live in a new file ckan/authz.py. authztool.py should probably move into cli.py and will just do command line parsing and printing and use ckan/authz.py. The updated web gui for authz will also use this code.

Tests should be made. There's already a file ckan/tests/test_authz.py, which looks like the appropriate place for new tests.

 * Rename ckan/authz.py to ckan/lib/authz.py or even ckan/logic/authz.py
