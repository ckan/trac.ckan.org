Dumps Interface (this is NOT going in the API, it is another interface of the service):
 - resources:
    Daily Dump Folder
    Daily Dump File
 - locations:
    /dump/hmg.ckan.net-YYYY-MM-DD.[json|csv].zip 
 - data format:
    Dump Folder is a HTML document containing a table of links to Dump Files
