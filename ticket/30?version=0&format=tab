30	Tags are added to a package by package owner	rgrp	johnbywater	"== As A ==

Package Owner

== I Want To ==

Create/Edit/Update/Delete tags associated with my package

== Notes ==

  * Tags are service-wide and '''not''' package specific
  * Tags should not allow spaces (but allow everything else e.g. ':')
  * web interface details
    * should provide a text box where users can add space separated tags (a la delicious).
    * tag creation should be seemless (so if a tag does not already tag exists it should automatically be created in the background)
    * would like to provide a list of relevant existing tags. For time being could just list all existing tags below entry box but in long run would like auto-updating/auto-suggesting listing a la delicious
