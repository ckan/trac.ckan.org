2686,enabling datastore & data API breaks recline,shevski,,"First I noticed that the gold prices dataset preview was not displaying & has data API enabled
Secondly I tried enabling datastore for http://datahub.io/dataset/adur_district_spending/resource/281dffa6-ea9b-4446-be41-05dced06591f and after I saved the preview no longer worked. Unticking the datastore & data api checkbox brought it back
