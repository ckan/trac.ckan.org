1626	'About CKAN' page update	dread	dread	thedatahub.org/about contains info that is very general to the CKAN and really quite technical. The text should be changed to be both specific to thedatahub.org and provide the context in a non-technical way. It should be easy to customise the About page to be appropriate for say new-york.ckan.net - a bit of info about who runs it, plus the general stuff about CKAN powering it and it was written by OKF to further open data.	enhancement	closed	major	ckan-sprint-2012-01-23	ckan	fixed		markw	ckan	none
