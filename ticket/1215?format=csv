1215,Edit Resources table - removing all rows prevents adding them again,dread,,"I'm not sure if this was reported earlier, but I have found a minor bug in the ""Add new package"" form. As far as I can see this bug exists in v1.3.2 and also in v1.4.1a (that runs on ckan.net). This is a problem with adding new resources in ""Resources"" section. To reproduce the bug do the following:

 1. Go to ""Add new package"", for instance http://ckan.net/package/new
 2. Scroll down to ""Resources"" section.
 3. Click on ""Remove this row"" link (red circle).
 4. Say ""Yes"" to ""Are you sure you wish to remove this row?""
 5. Now there should be no rows. Only the header ""URL*   Format  Description""
 6. Click on ""Add row to table""
 7. All you get now is another row with table header ""URL*        Format Description"". You will not be able to add any resources now. Solution is to reload the page.

The simplest solution to this bug will be to hide the ""Remove this
row"" link if there is only one row.",defect,closed,minor,,ckan,fixed,,,ckan,none
