93,Access control for packages,rgrp,rgrp,"A user's ability to edit a package should be configurable by an admin. Propose there are 3 level of capability/action for a package:

  * Admin
  * Edit
  * Read (optional at present since everything should be readable)

Cost: 6d

== Details ==

  * A package Admin should be able to change the permissions for the package for others.
  * A person registering a package (if logged in) automatically becomes an Admin for that package
  * By default being an Admin implies Editor implies Reader
  * By default edit rights are for everyone (as are read rights)
  * A system administrator may alter the package Admins for any package (this is optional since now that we have web admin interface for editing of model/DB could do this via that route)

=== Extras ===

May wish to expand edit permissions in future to e.g.:

  * Edit: core
  * Edit: tags
  * Edit: everything
