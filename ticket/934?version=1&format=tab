934	Key value store for extensions to store data	kindly		"We need to allow plugins to store information.

Each plug-in should have its own name space and allow any data to be set.

There are two options.  

 * make a key value table in ckan that will hold random information.
 * use redis (or other key value store)

If in sql suggest schema of form:

 * (namespace, obj_id, key, value [, value_type])
 * value is json"	enhancement	new	awaiting triage		ckan
