928	Documentation - CKAN credits / contributors page	rgrp	rgrp	" 1. Remove contributors list from about page (out-of-date and does not belong there)
  * A ""Powered by CKAN"" link in footer is enough
 2. Add contributors / team / credits page to ckan.org
  * May want to separate credits (e.g. software use), from contributors (also is team different from contributors)
  * (perhaps with photos!) so that people can see who is part of it and from which organisations. (this is medium-term, not really part of this ticket)
 3. ? CREDITS.txt file to the source repository and add a link to it on bitbucket for more detailed credits info.
