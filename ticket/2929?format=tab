2929	Remove is_fallback() from I*Form extension interfaces?	seanh		"If a plugin wants to take over the default package type for example, it can return ['dataset'] from its package_types() method. I don't see how there can be a package type that is not the default 'package' and is not returned by the package_types() method of a plugin, because the URLs for such a package type would not be mapped. Am I missing something or is is_fallback() not needed?

Same for IGroupForm and IOrganizationForm"	enhancement	new	awaiting triage	ckan 2.0	ckan				ckan	none
