653	Trackback links for packages	dread		"When people link to a package, a track-back link is auto-created. (Similar system as for blogs). 

As suggested by Tim Davies: 

Allowing some form of ‘track back’ against datasets
When a non-technical user comes to look at a dataset it would be really useful for them to be able to see if anyone has created an interface interpretation of it already.


I found quite a few cases in research of end-users struggling to make sense of a dataset when good interfaces to that data had already been built and blogged about, but without there being any link from the dataset listing to those data uses.
 
Accepting track backs could also make it easier for technical users to find blog posts / shared code etc. relating to a given dataset.
