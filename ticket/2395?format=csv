2395,paster db clean/init don't work when spatial extension enabled,dread,,"If you have a spatial enabled database then if you don't disable the spatial extension in the CKAN config temporarily then you get errors when you run paster db clean and paster db init.

Can't you just modify the clean and init functions to run without extensions enabled? 

The wider problem is that extensions do their own inits every time you do load_environment, which seems crazy and inefficient to me, since this occurs every time a request comes into CKAN. But that is another problem/ticket.",defect,new,minor,ckan-backlog,ckan,,,,ckan,none
