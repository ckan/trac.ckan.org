The ""find by tags"" algorithm uses (title, department).
Unfortunately some of the data already there has no
department. This causes it to make a new package (with
trailing underscore).

I've done a test for the missing department issue and I can't
reproduce the problem. This may be due to my general tidy up and
getting tests passing using the latest ckanclient. Anyway, can you
check over my test to see if this is what you mean?:
