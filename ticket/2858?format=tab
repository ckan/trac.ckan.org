2858	Harvester tweaks	toby	toby	"I've had a look at the new harvesting theme, it looks great, thanks. I
did some minor changes and reworded the errors as per tickets #2852
and #2853, but I kept the messages red, as the only other ones
available (""flash_notice"") are blue and are not very prominent.

Toby, on the old form there was a list of descriptions for all
available harvesters which could be nice to have back. I couldn't find
an easy way with the new form macro, so I don't know how easy would be
to implement
