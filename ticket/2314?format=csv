ckan.tests.lib.test_helpers.TestHelpers.test_parse_rfc_2822_gmt_case

ckan.tests.lib.test_helpers.TestHelpers.test_parse_rfc_2822_with_offset

have been failing in certain timezones. In the UK they pass, if you're in Germany they'll fail.

The function being tested uses datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp() which uses the local time, but the tests compare the results against hardcoded strings, so the tests cannot work in different timezones.",defect,closed,major,ckan-sprint-2012-05-15,ckan,fixed,[0.5d],,ckan,none
