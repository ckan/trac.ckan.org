2550,User types,ross,ross,"Requirements
------------

In the data hub plugin we require the ability to differentiate users between those that have paid for a service, and those that haven't. The distinction isn't boolean as there may be levels of service for paid users, so it may be that we need a 'type' of user where there are various grades of 'paid' which are likely to be strings (specific to the data hub).


Required interface
------------------

Once changes have been made to the user schema, for a given user we want to be able to:

 * determine if they have a paid or a free account, and
 * get a string name of the type of paid account.

Care should be taken to ensure that the 'paid' status of the user cannot be set through the API and only by the datahub plugin.
