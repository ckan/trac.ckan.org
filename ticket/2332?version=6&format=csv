2332,Fixes for v1.7 release,rgrp,rossjones,"A place to list crucial fixes for v1.7 release:

 * Related Item has comments on index page (they should not show up here -- why is this happening!)
 * Related item should be to left of history (history could in fact move to RHS)
   * What about losing icons since we duplicate for related item
 * Related item plus sign is very poorly aligned within box
  * Add related items should be in drop down like for resources (?) to make it easy to add items
  * Hover should show a title that gives some information about what related are (not at all clear)

Search results:

 * #2231 - search should add not or
 * Search results should be similar across group pages and normal search results (suggest adopting group page style)
  * Search results resource link should link to resource page rather than url for that resource
  * Suggest we could tidy this a bit (e.g. have resources in mini-sidebar of search result ...?)

Data viewer:

 * Merge updates to Recline (that did go in before deadline but do not seem to have made v1.7 branch) https://github.com/okfn/ckan/commit/146a5c1130cc77cb2ad2c6ef6b3a53074908bf07
  * Ensure still using read-only (this seems to have been lost in upgrade)
 * Do not show failed preview with red-bar (esp when just empty datastore ...)
 * (? not really a fix) Give out a link as well as embed instructions (I often want to link to the explorer in a given state)
  * Should this link to the resource page or to a dedicated viewer page - cf # 2322 (resource sub-urls like /download, /api ...)
  * Do #2322 ...

Dataset page:

 * Put home page link somewhere more prominent (e.g. the top of the sidebar)
 * Put author more prominent (at top right)
 * (? - new work) List CKAN owners at top right in sidebar
 * Make resources stand out more
 * Rename resources tab and heading to Data & Resources

Resource view:
 * Do not show no description in no description (just show dataset info)

Theme:
 * Fix spacing above page title (i.e. dataset title etc)
 * Bootstrap 2.0.2 (@zephod was *supposed* to have done this) - should be trivial and gives important bugfixes for data viewer
 * Fix subnav width on resources pages (does not extend all the way to the right like it should)
 * Fix spacing of top menu and search box (do not look right)

Miscellaneous:

 * Ensure that we out-of-the-box config for CKAN has:
  * Only logged in users able to create
  * Creation permissions have only creators able to update a dataset

Deployments (without deployment we cannot know these are working):

 * Social extension
 * Analytics
