1498	Support multiple SOLR schema versions	amercader	amercader	"At some point the SOLR schema used by CKAN will need to be changed and the changes won't be always backward compatible, so we need a mechanism to support instances that use older versions of the schema.
This process will involve:

 * Better documentation on how to deploy SOLR, as single instance or multicore
 * A convention on how to tag schema versions and SOLR endpoints to ensure that CKAN instances point to the correct SOLR URL.
 * (If possible) Checks in CKAN core that deal with different schema versions."	enhancement	closed	major	ckan-sprint-2011-12-05	ckan	fixed	solr search		ckan	migrations
