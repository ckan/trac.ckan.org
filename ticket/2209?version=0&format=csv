2209,Object->RDF mapping,ross,ross,"Super is [1649]

We need to provide customisable mappings between CKAN models and RDF. This needs to be easily configurable for different clients and should take into account objects related to the model being mapped.

Current contenders for impl are:

1. ordf.org's Object Description Mapper (which uses OWL)

2. RDFAlchemy, although this looks like it may result in fixed mappings

3. A custom scheme with a simple json file and a little bit of patience.
