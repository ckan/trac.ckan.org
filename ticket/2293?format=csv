2293,Rename of Group results in disappearance of associated datasets from group page,rgrp,ross,"Rename of group makes all the datasets associated with the group disappear on the group listing page. (But they are still there if you look at edit).

As group rename should be rare I'm marking this as minor though actual effect is major.
