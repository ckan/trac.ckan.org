1547	Add a search method to the IPackageController interface	amercader	amercader	"Add a search method to the IPackageController interface so extensions can modify the package results.
Extensions implementing the IPackageController interface will get the results from a SOLR query, and after playing with them should return an object with the same structure (so it can be transparently used by the web UI, etc) I.e. results should be a list of package_dictize outputs:

{{{
{
         'count': count,
         'facets': facets,
         'results': results
     }
}}}"	enhancement	new	major	ckan-sprint-2011-12-19	ckan		search		ckan	none
