817	Proposed redesign of Resources table on package pages	cygri		"There are some problems with the Resources table on package pages:

1. The column labelled “URL” doesn't contain URLs, but just the word “Download”.
2. The links labelled “Download” often are not download links, but something else (example links, API endpoints, documentation links).

Attached is a screenshot for a proposed redesign. The changes are:

1. Move the Format column to the right of the Description column (description is more important)
2. Make the description a clickable link
3. Drop the “URL/Download” column because it's now redundant
4. Rename “Description” to “Resource” (not that important)"	requirement	closed	awaiting triage	ckan-v1.3	ckan	worksforme
