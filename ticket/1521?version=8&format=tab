== Improved groups ==

From Richard Cyganiak.

This is a set of proposals to make the groups feature more powerful. As a result, currently separate CKAN instances such as http://ie.ckan.net/ could be turned into a simple group on the [http://thedatahub.org Data Hub] without losing their separate identity.

 * '''Group homepages:''' Make the group pages more attractive and welcoming as homepages. The main Data Hub homepage does a great job at this now – can the group pages be made more like that? They're quite uninformative and bland right now.
 * '''Subdomains for groups:''' Enable subdomains such as {{{ie.thedatahub.org}}} as aliases for {{{thedatahub.org/group/ireland}}}
 * '''Search within the group:''' Have a big search box that searches just within the group on the group page, with a look like on http://thedatahub.org/dataset
 * Have an '''Add a dataset to this group''' link on the group page, perhaps in the sidebar.
 * '''Navigation within the group:''' Have some more navigation starting points on the group page, e.g., the Tags + Resource Format sidebar from http://thedatahub.org/dataset
 * '''Group documentation:''' Add the ability to add more “About this group” text, or pages like “FAQ” and “Extra field conventions”.
  * The only place where one can currently put group-specific text is before the dataset list. Putting much text there is bad as it moves the datasets below the fold.
  * Can the top-level sections of a group's description be automatically turned into separate pages that are linked from the sidebar? With headlines ''About'', ''Frequently Asked Questions'' and ''How to get involved'', we'd then get three links in the sidebar that point to {{{datahub.org/group/ireland/about}}}, {{{datahub.org/group/ireland/frequently-asked-questions}}}, {{{datahub.org/group/ireland/how-to-get-involved}}}

== Additional ==

 * Display members of a group as well as admins (if less than 10? If more than 10 display count only ...?)
 * Better group index page (sort by number of dataset, allow searching ...) - #1403
  * Add search to groups: http://thedatahub.org/group
  * Way to filter by activity, number of datasets
 * #1597 '''Tag search, filtered by group'''
  * RP: not worth it in terms of benefit/cost IMO
