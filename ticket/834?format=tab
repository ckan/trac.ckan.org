834	Searching in CKAN	Alexander		"Hello.

I've installed stable CKAN v1.1 from PyPI.

I can't find any docs about using CKAN API in order to query packages.

Query ./api/search/package?q=str works fine, but with extra parameters, such as limit, offset, fullinfo, order_by, search_notes, don't. Should I use new version for this? How can I perform this query via Ckanclient? Is it possible?

Also I'm interested how to find open-licensed files? I tied URL ./api/search/package?q=str&open_only=1&downloadable_only=1 and Ckanclient:

result = ckan.package_search('str', {'open_only': 1, 'downloadable_only': 1})

As result nothing found.

Thanks."	task	closed	awaiting triage	ckan-v1.3	ckan	worksforme
