543	Investigate partial page caching and edge-side includes	rgrp	wwaites	"Edge-side includes or partial page caching are a standard way to deal with caching of pages in which some (usually small) part of the content cannot be cached or should be cached in a different manner (e.g. much more briefly) than the rest of the page.

Edge-side includes have the advantage that they integrate with general 3rd-party caching systems such as varnish.

Introducing either partial page or ESI will require some overhaul work to change the page render processing somewhat."	task	closed	awaiting triage		ckan	duplicate			ckan	none
