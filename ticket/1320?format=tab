1320	Extend basic markdown to support normal http / https links	rgrp	zephod	"It is very annoying that you have to wrap links in <...> and most people don't bother. Extend h.markdown in code and markdown in js to fix this.

(We should also support 'package' links etc in javascript?)

*ADDITIONAL*
  * Note that CKAN flavoured markdown will not currently recognise dataset:my_data links (still uses package).
  * Move the markdown api to /util/markdown
