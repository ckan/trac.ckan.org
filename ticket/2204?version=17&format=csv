2204,[super] Related (Stuff) Extension,rgrp,ross,"This is a reworking of the existing apps extension.

Initial proposal at http://wiki.ckan.org/Proposals#Apps_in_CKAN and http://wiki.ckan.org/Proposals#References.2FLinks_in_CKAN

== Naming ==

What do we call this extension?

 * related
  * RP best IMO but perhaps too close to separate relationships concept?
 * relatedstuff
 * links
 * references

== Proposal ==

""Related Stuff"": Apps as in an application (website/service/tool) that uses this dataset (as in Apps and Ideas extension)

 * This case seems a general example of wanting to link some external thing to a dataset (e.g. this policy paper refs this dataset, this application uses this dataset, this visualization is built on this dataset cf http://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/ckan-discuss/2011-August/001607.html)

== Implementation ==

New table named Related with following structure

{{{
|| id (int) || type || title || description (markdown) || image_url || owner_id || url || created (timestamp)
}}}


 * type = Idea | App | API | Visualization | Post | Paper | News Article
  * Suggest we make this a ckan.ini config option (comma separated ...?)
        * Do we want the possibility of different templates for different types of Related objects?

  * image: ?? Depends where we store images. Simplest option would be to change to image_url and leave it to users to have already uploaded an image somewhere. If not we need to support image uploading and storage. See #1692 (add image attribute to datasets and groups) for more discussion, once implemented the URL here can be an internal url.

 * owner_id = user_id or creating user (see authorization below) 

Related2Dataset (note that related_id, dataset_id tuple should be unique). This allows for m2m connections. If a given related item is only with one dataset this could be simplified. May contain status so dataset owner can turn this on/off.

{{{
|| id || dataset_id || related_id || status
}}}

status should be used to allow for a dataset owner (for dataset_id) to de-activate the relationship between the dataset and the related.

=== Url ===

 * /dataset/{dataset-name}/related/{related-item-id}/{related-item-title-stringified}
  * If a reference item could exist in its own right (and perhaps refer to multiple datasets then it should get its own url at e.g. /related/{id}
 * /dataset/{dataset-name}/related/add => Modal dialog on related tab so we can use API to create them.

/dataset/{id}/related <- list
    * use image_url for small icon etc, title description (shortened?)
    * Click through to full related item (optional)
    * dataset owner is shown show / hide button ... (or on /dataset/{id}/related/{id} )
    * related owner sees an edit button / icon (pops up modal)

/dataset/{id}/related/{id} (optional)

/dataset/{id} will have a Related tab (with bubble with count).
  * Drop down with Add Related -> Pop-up modal and save via API
      (Not used: /related/add with dataset prefilled ... )
/related/{id}/edit

=== Authorization ===

Addition of related item be considered orthogonal to datasets (and hence with separate authorization i.e. i can add the info that site X uses dataset Y without needing permission to edit dataset Y).

Thus any logged in user could add a Related item. We set the owner of the related item to creating user and going forward only that user or a sysadmin can update or delete.

NB: we could have a system where datasets owners have to approve related items before they show up next to their dataset. This would add substantial complexity so I propose we leave out of phase 1.
