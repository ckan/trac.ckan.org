1402	Migrate repository from mercurial to git	rgrp	kindly	"Plan to migrate from mercurial git

 * Convert from mercurial to git
  * Map named branches to normal branches
  * Also, if possible map usernames for RP: rgrp <http://rufuspollock.org/> (mercurial) -> rgrp <rufus.pollock@okfn.org>
 * Place at http://github.com/okfn/ckan (can delete current repo there as an out of date mirror)

Process:

 * Do trial run
 * Announce conversion date / time
 * Require everyone to have pushed '''all''' outstanding changes at that time
 * Do conversion
 * Test
 * Announce on list and ckan.org/
