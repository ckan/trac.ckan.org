1740,Get rid of `from module import ...`,seanh,,"It's really bad to do {{{from module import *}}} and CKAN has a lot of them. I suggest a three-pronged approach:

1. Don't add any more of them.

2. When you're programming if you see an easy opportunity to remove one then do so.

3. At some point we should task someone to go through the code and remove them all (which is what this ticket is for), but this will be a big job and may break things.

We should also get rid of most or all of the {{{from module import foo}}} and {{{from module import foo, bar}}} statements.

I think the right thing to do is just {{{import module}}} and then use {{{module.foo}}} in your code. But if you find yourself doing {{{module.foo.bar}}} then you may have a code smell.
