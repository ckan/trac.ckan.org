42	In WUI where List of Items to Display is Large Results should be Paged	rgrp	rgrp	"= As A =

Visitor

= I Want To =

View lists of items but not have too many on a page (as this leads to slow page loads and difficulty navigating the list). Where there are more items in the results of my action that can be fit on a single page the results should be 'paged' in some manner.

= Details =

Main place this issue arises:

  * List of tags
  * List of packages
  * Repository history (/revision)

Should probably have no more than 50 (or so) items on a page. Obvious solution is for actions that return lists to have some kind of pageno parameter and then use this in controller to select what to display."	enhancement	closed	critical	v0.6	ckan	fixed
