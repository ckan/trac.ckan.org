1076	Improve revision and package purge system	rgrp	johnlawrenceaspden	"== Purging Revisions ==

 * Delete button displayed on:
  * /revision/list
  * ~~(/package/history)~~
   * /package/history is problematic because html does not allow nested forms and we already have form for doing diff/comparison.
  * /revision/{id}
 * Delete button submits to delete action on revision and changes revision state to 'deleted'.
  * undelete button now displayed and revisions are marked as deleted in some way (e.g. greyed out?)
 * Sysadmins then visit /ckan-admin/trash which lists all revisions with deleted state. There is a large button: ""Empty trash"" (irreversible). Click button purges all revisions with deleted state.

== Purging Packages ==

 * Put into deleted state.
 * Listed on /ckan-admin/trash
 * Separate Empty trash button which deletes all associated revisions.
  * Should be separate from Empty trash for revisions

== Current system ==

 * Single purge link on revision listing if a sysadmin which permanently purges the revision and all associated changes (without confirmation atm!)
