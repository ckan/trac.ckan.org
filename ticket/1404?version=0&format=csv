1404,Post-v1.5 UX improvements,zephod,zephod,"Various UX improvements, bugs, and suggestions are collected here:

  * [general]: Empty tables have a '(none)' placeholder which is causing issues. Move it into a separate div - it doesn't need be a wide <td> object.
  * [dataset/edit]: Errors in form - would be nice to auto-open the appropriate resource box.
  * [search]: Declutter the sidebar. No yellow box.
  * [search]: Facets to go on the left, rather than the right. More logical flow.
