1492,Interference between extra and relationship fields in API,dread,kindly,"From Jan Kuƒçera <elquenor@gmail.com>

 I have also tried to use extras fields to store information about relationships between datasets. I found out that if you first add relationship using CKAN API into dataset relationships attribute and than you add extras field for the same relationship with key in format ""parent_of:dataset_name"" or ""child_of:dataset_name"", storing this extras field will clear all relationships in relationships attribute stored earlier.
 
 I might be some kind of bug but I suppose you will know better. Is it possible to use relationships attribute and extras field for relationships at the same time?
