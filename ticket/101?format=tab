101	(Improved) Download support	rgrp	rgrp	"  1. Given a url download from that url to disk
  2. Given a package use download url to download to disk

Once on disk should uncompress (if necessary).

== Details ==

  * Should download either to tmp directory (defaulted in config) or a specified path on disk
  * In download would like to support as many types of target urls as possible:
    1. Single files (usually compressed filesets but could be individual files)
    2. Index pages listing files to download
    3. Revision control repositories
    4. ...

  This will obviously be a significant amount of work. Suggest:
    1. Start off just supporting the first option.
    2. Have something like a plugin system to handle new target types
    3. Reuse existing work (e.g. easy_install and pip handle standard vcs such as svn, hg, git etc)

Cost: 1d
