218,UI Review - Package listing,dread,nickstenning," * openness/downloadability ticks/crosses are totally inscrutable to non-techies (those who don't know about the title attribute). need better icons, and a key in a box on RHS.
 * maybe highlight two-tick entries with a particular colour, but the open knowledge badge is horrendous, and breaks visual cadence.
 * results data should be tabulated, with the project names and descriptions made most prominent. <li> blobs are unnecessary visual noise.
 * maybe links should go on the full titles? Get rid of package names.
 * Should have filter by name (Ã  la KForge alphanum widget) and also by tag: list of most common tags in box on RHS?
 * same comments as search listing (ticket:217)
