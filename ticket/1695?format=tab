1695	Relationships - improvements	dread	dread	"Suggested by Richard Cyganiak in http://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/ckan-discuss/2012-January/001977.html

 * new relationship type links_to / linked_from
   * Maybe with extra 'count' property?
 * creating a new relationship should be post to the relationship register, not the source entity.
 * add missing doc about creating a new relationship
 * 'Model Formats' section seems to be missed out of the docs since release 1.4.2. See: http://readthedocs.org/docs/ckan/en/ckan-1.4.2/api/version2.html#model-formats
