108,Package search in the REST API,rgrp,dread,"Add package search facility in the rest api at /api/search

Queries can be provided as for the normal package search either by posting to that url or by performing a get with a query string.

E.g. .../api/search/package?q=xyz

Query parameter q:
  * keyword string (searches name, title, tags by default)
    * split by words and ANDed
  * Searching by specific fields (in addition to keyword string). Pass in a query parameter qjson '''instead''' of q. Payload to json is a JSON-encoded dict which is a dictionary with a q field for free text (keywords) and additional key/value pairs for specific fields
     * if q and qjson specified ignore q and just process qjson value

Additional parameters in addition to query (""q"" or ""qjson"") are:
  * limit
  * offset
  * fullinfo=0/1 - return full record for each result (default=0)
  * order_by=field_name
  * search_notes=0/1 (default 0) do we search notes field in a keyword search

Return value is json encoded dictionary with keys:
  * 'results': list of results
  * 'count': total number of results

=== Extras (for the future) ===

  * Prioritisation is not part of this ticket (requires fulltext support in DB or in external app such as Xapian) 
TODO?: provide query parameters as key value pairs or as json-encoded dictionary?
