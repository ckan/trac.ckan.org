Relationship type values:
is_dependent_on (is_dependency_of)
is_derived_from (has_derivation)

Relationship type is stored as a string, as given in the first column. The reverse relationship (bracketed) is given just for display purposes only.

Subject / Object - as in a sentence: ""Dracos is derived from OSM"" is <subject> <predicate> <object>. We'll use 'type' instead of 'predicate' as that is a more familiar word.
