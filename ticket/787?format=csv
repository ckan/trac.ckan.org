787,Auth API,thejimmyg,thejimmyg,"Auth Proposal

Use case: We'd like an authenticated and authorized Drupal user to be able to
edit/delete packages using the API

To do this a user would need a CKAN API key so we need some way of Drupal
telling CKAN who a user is so that they can get their API key.

Proposed Implementation
-----------------------

A user visits the CKAN API key page to get their key. Because CKAN is at
catalogue.data.gov.uk (a subdomain of the Drupal site) it can read Drupal
cookies.

If there is no ``DRXtrArgs`` or ``DRXtrArgs2`` cookie, we know the user isn't
signed in so we redirect them to Drupal to sign in.

WISHLIST: It would be really nice if we could pass the URL to redirect back to
Drupal so tha Druapl can send them back to the CKAN API key page

Either way, they get back to CKAN and now the cookies exist. When the first
HTTP request header is sent, CKAN will read the Drupal session ID and then call
a Drupal API, server to server.

TODO: Implement an API on the drupal server which accepts a Drupal session ID
as an argument and returns the username and credentials, but only if the
request if from the CKAN server (perhaps we specify an API key in the request)

If the session is valid CKAN will set its own auth cookie and show them the
page with the API key. CKAN only considers a user signed in if both the CKAN
cookie *and* Drupal session ID are present. If at any time they sign out of
Drupal the Drupal session disappears so they will be signed out of CKAN too.

Now the user has an API key they can use the standard CKAN command line API
tools.

The API key is the only thing the user will need to use the CKAN API. This
poses a problem. What if a user is removed from Drupal but still has a CKAN API
key?

Two solutions:

1. API keys will be set to only be valid for the length of a Drupal session so
   that a user will only be able to use the write API for a little time after
   credentials are revoked

2. CKAN provides an API to allow Drupal to revoke keys

Option 1. seems easier to me. If we choose this we will write a ``get_api_key``
command line tool so that Drupal user can write things like this:

::

    datapkg list_packages --api_key `get_api_key`
 
The ``get_api_key`` function will prompt for username and password and then
perform the steps necessary to get an API key.",task,closed,major,ckan-sprint-2011-09-12,dgu,fixed,dgu,,ckan,none
