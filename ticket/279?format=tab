279	Ensure package's license is an option when it's edited	dread	johnbywater	"With forms configurable to show a subset of licenses and ckan instances moving packages from server to server, there is a chance that a user will edit a package and the existing package's license is not displayed in the form. If the user submits this form without touching the license dropdown, then the value is lost. 

So for this case we should add the package's license to the list displayed."	enhancement	closed	minor	v1.0	ckan	fixed
