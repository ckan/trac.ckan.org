 * Server returns text/html for errors even when ""Accept: application/json"" header is set.
 * DELETE package request requires a Content-Length? Should be 405 Method Not Allowed?
 * Tag returned as a JSON object when updating but as a string when requesting. Same with ""extras"" content.
 * How to remove key from ""extras"" object? Passing None as described in the docs is invalid JSON and using null doesn't work.
 * Tags return package names rather than ids when querying GET /tag/{id}
 * Doesn't return rendered_text property on package update.
 * Relationships use ""object"" key rather than id or package_id.",defect,closed,major,,ckan,worksforme,,aron@â€¦,ckan,none
