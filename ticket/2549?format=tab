2549	Merge organization logic into groups	ross	ross	"
== Requirements ==

Merge the organizations plugin into the core groups functionality. Most of this is templating and a small number of changes to the group controller.

Investigate the possibility of removing the Membership model and using FKs.

== Interface ==

This is likely to consist of:

 * Updating the templates in templates/group/

 * Configuring whether we want to constrain datasets to a single group (as per organizations)

 * Implementing the separate user management (add users to group).

 * Checking the publisher auth to not necessarily rely on group type = 'organization'

 * Making sure that the changes still work with publisher auth.
