906,Ability to search without accents for accented words,Stiivi,thejimmyg,"In Slovakia users are expecting from sites to be able to search without typing accents, for example if they do not have SK keyboard, just US. For example searching for: 'Obyvateľstvo' and 'obyvatelstvo' (population) or 'štatistika' and 'statistika' (statistics) should yield same results.

This should work the other way around as well, as some people might enter entries without accents into CKAN instance and others might search with accents.

For SK language simple ASCII transliteration for searched term and indexed words is sufficient (iconv ASCII//TRANSLIT).
