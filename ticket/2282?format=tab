2282	log api calls for users	toby	toby	"This was part of #2251 but is now it's own ticket.

we need clarity on this.  The use cases so far have been possible limiting api calls for users.

so we want to monitor the user or ip address

what about the api calls?

do we want to record all calls or just some?  do we want to record the type of call and to what level of detail?

recording the url just seems to specific to me."	enhancement	new	awaiting triage	ckan-future	ckan				ckan	none
