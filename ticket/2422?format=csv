2422,Paster rights command appears broken,ross,kindly,"Reported in IRC by @floapps


In previous ckan versions i could use paster commands to remove reader rights from visitors on all packages
and this would then throw the user to login screen when trying to see a dataset but, when i did this in ckan 1.7, i could still see all datasets as a visitor

Using http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/authorization.html#permissions-publisher-mode

    paster rights remove visitor reader package:all


Also has an empty list of roles in config for default visitor roles

I tested on my local install and could replicate with that command doing nothing. Neither affects existing or newly created datasets.",defect,closed,awaiting triage,,ckan,invalid,,,ckan,none
