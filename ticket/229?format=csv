229,Resource hashes,dread,dread,"New field for resources - hash of the resource file.

 * CKAN itself will not calculate the hash value - user just pastes it in.
 * Display text field in resource table.
 * Requires migration script.

Questions for the field's value:

1. Which hash to use? Restrict to python hashlib and other major hash libraries.

2. Should we use merkle trees?

Thanks to Julien D'Assanges for the suggestion.
