190	Package comments	dread	pudo	"Cost 7 days

When viewing a package, users can read user comments and leave their own. Users need to be logged in to leave a message. Comments appear immediately. A mechanism for deleting unwanted comments is provided to an authorized user. Comments are sorted with the most recent first. Comments are available for read, creation and deletion in both the Web UI and over the REST API. 

The admin for the package and a superuser can delete unwanted comments, both on the package page and a collation of all comments on their user page. Users can delete their own comments(?) Need to consider whether over the REST API we encourage the use of a 'frontend user' APIKEY which can be used to leave comments for another, actual user.

Example at bottom of package page:

'''Leave a comment:'''
||Subject||  _________  ||
||Comment||  _________  || 
[[br]]
||Submit button||

'''Comments:'''

||It says on the pollution data web page that not all the stations have a CO2 sensor, so you have to extrapolate from the ones that do. See my visualisation of CO2 across London for an idea of what you can do: bertdavies.com/pollution-2008.jpg||

||Excellent data, but why is there no value in the CO2 column for some of the testing stations?||
