In my use case I need to fetch every sparql endpoint associated to a dataset. With the previous version of your endpoint, I was doing this query:
SELECT DISTINCT ?dataset ?endpoint ?title ?identifier WHERE { 
	?dataset <http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#distribution> ?distribution. 
	?distribution <http://purl.org/dc/terms/format> [ <http://moat-project.org/ns#taggedWithTag> [ <http://moat-project.org/ns#name> ""api/sparql"" ] ]. 
	?distribution <http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#accessURL> ?endpoint. 
	?dataset <http://purl.org/dc/terms/title> ?title.  
	?dataset <http://purl.org/dc/terms/identifier> ?identifier. 
} ORDER BY ?title

Using your new version,dcterms:title of a dataset is now a rdfs:label ... OK

Unfortunately, I don't have the information of ""api/sparql""  anymore. So I can not differentiate between a dump file and a SPARQL endpoint...
