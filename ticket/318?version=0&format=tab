318	Insufficient validation of resource URIs	wwaites	rgrp	"The CKAN instance on data.gov.uk serves invalid URIs out of its API.

For example the following can be found,

http://uk.sitestat.com/homeoffice/rds/s?rds.hosb0509tabsxls&ns_type=pdf&ns_url=[http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs09/hosb0509tabs.xls]

In this URI, the : and / characters after the ? in the query part are invalid according to section 3.4 of RFC2396

Also URIs are not stripped of whitespace at the end.

This causes problems when other software with a more correct interpretation of what a valid URI is attempts to consume data from CKAN. In this instance the Talis triplestore complains about such URIs.
