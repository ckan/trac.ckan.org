833,Administrative dashboard extension,rgrp,,"Create an admin dashboard as /admin/ allowing for admin operations and overview.

Possible features:
  * Purge revisions (or sets of revisions)
  * Purge objects
  * Set roles for users
    * Put system into particular modes e.g. wiki mode (anyone can add, edit packages by default), data portal (only sysadmins or members of a special Editor group can create and edit packages)
  * Overview of activity

Currently have an admin section using the formalchemy admin controller to provide basic editing of model objects. This can still be used but located at /admin/model/.

=== Notes ===

Here's putting into restricted mode (plus creating a dedicated authz group so that others can admin sysadmin simply through that group):

{{{
# first remove permissions from roles
# this is hacky but have to do it because we hardcode assignment of 
# role permissions on package on package create (see model/authz.py)
paster roles deny editor edit
paster roles deny editor create-authorization-group
paster roles deny editor create-group
paster roles deny editor create-package
paster roles deny reader create-package
# make superuser
paster rights make {username} admin system
# make superuser group
paster rights make agroup:{admin-group} admin system
