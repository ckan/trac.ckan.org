1003	CKAN Javascript library and demonstration web interface	rgrp	rgrp	"A plain javascript library for interfacing with CKAN would be very useful (why? see below!). It would also be nice to have a pure html + javascript web interface to CKAN both for its own sake and to act as a demonstrator for the library.

Why?

 * Development of bespoke interfaces -- much easier to edit html + javascript than to change ckan core
  * E.g. for specific communities e.g. geodata, science
  * Specialized tasks - multi-package editing
 * Very easy deployment and integration (e.g. can drop in to getthedata or other sites)
