2500	get_action should raise an exception if the action requested doesn't exist	icmurray	ross	"== Original bug report: ==

> Hi CKAN devs,
>
> Can I request that ckan.logic.get_action raises an exception if
> the action requested doesn't exist?

> Two of us had a frustrating time tracking down an exception this
> morning. It's difficult when the exception is raised in python in a
> template because you don't get a line number. The problem was caused
> by a new logic function being added to another extension, and we
> hadn't updated the code there. So if get_action raised an proper
> exception rather than silently returning None then I think we'd have
> found the problem quicker.

> I'd write the code for this, but as I understand that the new system
> would require a ticket, branch, pull request, code review, merge. It
> seems a lot to do for such a small thing.
