1506	[super] UX improvements to dataset edit, create and search + group + user page (Dec 2011)	rgrp	zephod	"TODO: create smaller tickets

See also: http://trac.ckan.org/ticket/1404 (Post-v1.5 UX improvements) -- probably want to integrate with this and subtickets.

Note: dataset (and resource) view UX improvements are #1450 and #1032

== Dataset edit ==

  * See #1744 
  * Rewrite resource edit process
  * Fix display of large datasets (http://test.ckan.net/dataset/europeana-lod)
  * Fix animation glitch in expanding description
  * Can we make the list of files look more like a table? Lose space between files? Lose rounded corners?

== Dataset Create ==

  * ""Upload or link data files, APIs and other materials related to your dataset.""
  * Include the description markdown editor again (keep it small)
  * Licence should maybe be restored
    * ""(Don't worry if you don't know what your licence is)""
  * Show the log message field
    * Beautify
  * Pre-populate the log message field?
  * ? Show Home Page field when creating dataset (+ show description (?) (-- but state that it should just be a few lines)
  * ?  Do some Guerilla UX to see whether we need to Redirect to Resources directly after dataset creation?

== Group Improvements ==

 * Minor fixes to dataset add on Group edit form - 0.5d - #1507

== User pages ==

 * Improvements to user page UX - 1d - #1396
 * Broken links for non-Gravatar use icons - 0.25d - #1719

== Etc ==
  * Take before and after screenshots
  * Write tests. You may not close this ticket without writing some tests for /editresources!
