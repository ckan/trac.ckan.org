852	Dataset upload feature (master ticket)	wwaites	wwaites	"2 (4) use cases: (With and without access to auth keys.)

 1. upload form on ckan (by default local system has auth key for storage)
 2. datapkg upload (client) (by default without key) (plumbing done)

Most important are:

1. Upload form on ckan.net (with access to keys)
2. API for getting credentials for upload from ckan.net api (without access to keys).

Aside: Once 2 was done we could deprecate storage.ckan.net
