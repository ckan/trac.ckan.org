826	Resource 'extra' fields	dread	kindly	"There are a number of extra properties we want to store in a resource: 

 * resource size (in bytes, no. triples etc.) - https://trac.dataco.coi.gov.uk/projects/datagov/ticket/673
 * resource hash is 'static' (default) or 'changeable' - https://trac.dataco.coi.gov.uk/projects/datagov/ticket/674
 * alternative link (e.g. TNA Web Archive) to use the link is broken - https://trac.dataco.coi.gov.uk/projects/datagov/ticket/173

Need to be able to read/write these values in web interface and API.

(At some point we may wish to have custom form widgets for these new fields in the resource table, but let's leave this for the future.)

I suggest these are arbitrary key/value pairs, just like package extras, reusing PackageExtra code as much as possible.
(Other much more radical alternative is to move model to RDF.)"	enhancement	closed	critical	ckan-v1.4-sprint-1	ckan	fixed		thejimmyg	ckan	none
