3006	Update translations from Transifex	seanh		There are some new translations already on the CKAN 1.8 resource on Transifex already (e.g. 100% Norwegian translation I think). We should at least pull these from Transifex for 1.8.1, and may as well do a call for translations too.	enhancement	new	awaiting triage	ckan-v1.8.1	ckan		i18n		ckan	none
