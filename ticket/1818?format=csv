Right now users need to manually enter a geojson value in the 'spatial' extra field in order to define a geometry for a dataset.

We need a map widget on the edit form that allows users to draw the geometry on top of a map. This will be based on the draw functions offered by OpenLayers [1], [2].

Things to take into account:
 * Integration with the form sections.
 * Allow some degree of configuration (default extent, limit geometry types...)
