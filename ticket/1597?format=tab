1597	Tag search - filter by group	dread		"I want to browse tags, but filtered for a particular group. Currently our tag API doesn't allow for filtering by group. 

This is important for improving groups as communities within a site #1521. It would be easy to do this by adding an option to filter by a group. BUT are there any other use cases that would warrant a more complete faceted tag search?

--

BTW I can currently draw a tag cloud for a group - I can get the top tags used in a group like this:

curl http://thedatahub.org/api/action/package_search -d
'{""q"":""groups:country-ca"", ""facet.field"":""tags"", ""rows"":""0""}'

but it only contains the top 20 tags."	enhancement	closed	minor	ckan-sprint-2012-01-23	ckan	fixed			ckan	none
