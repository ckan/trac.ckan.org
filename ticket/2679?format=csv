2679,Change default behaviour of TemplateController.view to 404.,icmurray,icmurray,"The current behaviour of TemplateController.view() (which is the fallback controller should all others fail) is to attempt to render (as a genshi template) the requested file.

Although this may be a feature that some instances want.  In general, it leads to:

- 500s when attempting to access a normal template (eg - http://datahub.io/importer/preview)
- A way of inadvertantly serving things you may not want to serve.  (Small risk, as it needs to be renderable as a genshi template).

Solution:

- Change the controller to 404
- Ensure there's a way for existing ckan instances to override that behaviour should they need it.",enhancement,new,minor,ckan-v1.9,ckan,,,,ckan,none
