2900	snippets/package_list.html template crashes on dataset that has no 'notes'	seanh		"Sometimes a dataset dict comes through package_show() with 'notes': None and then the 'notes' key gets stripped from the dict when validation happens (validation only happens if there's an IDatasetForm plugin with a db_to_form_schema() method) and then package_list.html template crashes, e.g. on user profile pages.

Fix in the template? Or in the schema?

The template also crashes on packages with no tags (empty list gets stripped from dict) and probably other empty fields as well"	defect	new	awaiting triage	ckan-v1.8.1	ckan				ckan	none
