  * Number of package page visits on ckan (can we get this straight from google analytics)
  * Number of times url or download url is used

  * Google analytics will miss a lot of this usage (and how do we get that data out anyway)
  * Could use javascript but again misses usage.
  * One option is to redirect link but that is kind of nasty (but may be only option ...)
