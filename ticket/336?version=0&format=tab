336	Resource extension to REST API	donovanhide		"Hi,
have attached a patch for adding a resource list api call. Have also added a JSONP compatible callback section, along the lines of #388.

Could also add a search version. Not sure what the best url would be for that though.

Haven't written a test as the structure seems to follow a functional spec. Is that document around somewhere?"	enhancement	new	awaiting triage	v1.1	ckan		rest resource
