227,UI Review - General checks,dread,nickstenning," * There is huge inconsistency in the titles of pages across the site: to give one example ""Edit Package:"" vs ""Package: mypkg [not linked]"" vs ""History - mypkg [linked to package page]""
   * Normalize and use terminology: ""Data Package"" - also change in navbar (but nowhere else for the time being). So hvae Data Package - mypkg, Data Package - mypkg - Edit etc
 * pagination is currently lost in amongst the results list. needs to be *much* more obvious, and should appear top and bottom, or at the very least at the bottom!
