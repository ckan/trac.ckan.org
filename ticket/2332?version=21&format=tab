2332	Fixes for v1.7 release	rgrp	amercader	"A place to list crucial fixes for v1.7 release:

Related extension:

All not complete now moved to #2347

 * ~~Related Item has comments on index page (they should not show up here -- why is this happening!)~~
 * ~~Related item should be to left of history (history could in fact move to RHS)~~
   * What about losing icons since we duplicate for related item
 * Related item plus sign is very poorly aligned within box
  * Add related items should be in drop down like for resources (?) to make it easy to add items
  * Hover should show a title that gives some information about what related are (not at all clear)
 * Related item only includes App, Idea, Visualization but not API  | Post | Paper | News Article options as in original ticket #2204

Search results:

 * #2331 - search should add not or
 * ~~Search results should be similar across group pages and normal search results (suggest adopting group page style)~~
  * Search results resource link should link to resource page rather than url for that resource
  * Suggest we could tidy this a bit (e.g. have resources in mini-sidebar of search result ...?)

Data viewer:

 * ~~Merge updates to Recline (that did go in before deadline but do not seem to have made v1.7 branch) https://github.com/okfn/ckan/commit/146a5c1130cc77cb2ad2c6ef6b3a53074908bf07~~
  * Ensure still using read-only (this seems to have been lost in upgrade)
 * Do not show failed preview with red-bar (esp when just empty datastore ...)
    a) Data Viewer checks if datastore is empty nad falls back to ther options if emtpy
    b) DataStore enabled is off by default and only turned on either explicitly by user or by DataStorer on successful store ...
 * (? not really a fix) Give out a link as well as embed instructions (I often want to link to the explorer in a given state)
  * Should this link to the resource page or to a dedicated viewer page - cf # 2322 (resource sub-urls like /download, /api ...)
  * Do #2322 ...
 * Decent powered by icon for the Embed for the DataHub (make this text customizable and allow html ...)
 * Embed link uses uuid rather than dataset name (this goes to perma-url question ...)
 * Data viewer embed url includes all the resource info

Dataset page:

 * Put home page link somewhere more prominent (e.g. the top of the sidebar)
 * Put author more prominent (at top right)
 * (? - new work) List CKAN owners at top right in sidebar
 * Make resources stand out more
 * Rename resources tab and heading to Data & Resources

Dataset edit and create:

 * Corrections to dataset creation form for v1.7 - #2317
 * Better auto-complete for groups on dataset edit/new page - #2319
  * Remove groups box and replace with tags on the new page (or is this needed for organizations stuff?)
 * Description / notes text area is not wide enough.
   * Should also be larger on edit page
 * Problem with date instructions on add/edit resource: ""Dates are in ISO Format â€” eg. 2012-12-25 or %c2010-05-31T14:30%d.""
 * Add/edit resource: new code to auto-check urls being added is great but from UX point of view has draw back that (esp on low speed connections) page just seems to hang for a long time with nothing happening. I wonder if either
   * A) this could happen after resource created on form (e.g. it creates, and then an overlay comes up saying: checking url and gathering url information or similar) 
   * Or B) we still do this before creating new resource form on page but we still should show something like a spinner and some info like ""checking url and gathering url info ...)

Resource view:
 * Do not show no description in no description (just show dataset info)

Theme:
 * ~~Fix spacing above page title (i.e. dataset title etc)~~
 * ~~Bootstrap 2.0.2 (@zephod was *supposed* to have done this) - should be trivial and gives important bugfixes for data viewer~~
 * ~~Fix subnav width on resources pages (does not extend all the way to the right like it should)~~
 * ~~Fix spacing of top menu and search box (do not look right)~~
 * Group pages:
  * view page: image / logo is really poorly locate and sized, see e.g. http://datahub.io/group/wikimedia
  * ~~view page: admin heading on RHS sidebar is wrongly indented~~

Miscellaneous:

 * Ensure that we out-of-the-box config for CKAN has (#2388):
  * Only logged in users able to create
  * Creation permissions have only creators able to update a dataset

Deployments (without deployment we cannot know these are working):

 * ~~Social extension~~
 * ~~Analytics~~"	enhancement	assigned	critical	ckan-v1.7	ckan				ckan	none
