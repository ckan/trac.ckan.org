1692,Add image attribute to Dataset and Group,rgrp,,"Add image attribute for Dataset and Group which would be shown in prominent place.

For dataset this could be a relevant image and for Group this would be more of a logo.

I think this has very high value from a UX point of view.

== Issues ==

 * Do we need to support uploading and storing the image (or do users store elsewhere)
  * Could use something like transloadit service
  * Use our own storage facility with a reserved directory
 * Do we need to do resizing etc?
  * Maybe. Perhaps can prefer this in reasonably small size and then just size down in css for thumbnails etc.
