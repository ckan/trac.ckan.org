1796	Get rid of lxml dependency	dread	ross	"lxml is used in CKAN core in two places:
 * ckan/lib/helpers.py:239 Parsing Markdown and ensuring it is valid XML (i.e. tags close nicely so the HTML of the rest of the CKAN page is not disruptable).
 * reading the SOLR config XML to determine what version it is.

Both of these could be done with xml.dom built into Python and would save us a sizeable and slightly problematic dependency.

lxml is needed by these extensions: ckanext-inspire, ckanext-harvest, ckanext-csw & ckanext-wordpresser, so we'd have to add this to their requirements."	enhancement	closed	awaiting triage	ckan-future	ckan	fixed		rgrp kindly	ckan	none
