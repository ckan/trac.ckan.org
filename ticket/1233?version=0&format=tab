1233	[super] Improve wiki-style functionality for history	thejimmyg		"At the moment we have a good revisioning system but a poor history interface. We need to improve this in a number of areas:

 * Package history page should provide links to pages at particular revisions, similar to the wikipedia pages
 * Viewing old revisions or unmoderated changes should have a message at the top of the package page
 * Other improvements as per my word doc."	enhancement	new	awaiting triage	ckan-v1.5	ckan				ckan	none
