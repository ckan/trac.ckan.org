2332,Fixes for v1.7 release,rgrp,rossjones,"A place to list crucial fixes for v1.7 release:

 * Related Item has comments on index page (they should not show up here -- why is this happening!)
 * Related item should be to left of history (history could in fact move to RHS)
   * What about losing icons since we duplicate for related item
 * Related item plus sign is very poorly aligned within box
  * Add related items should be in drop down like for resources (?) to make it easy to add items
  * Hover should show a title that gives some information about what related are (not at all clear)

Search results:

 * #2231 - search should add not or
 * Search results should be similar across group pages and normal search results (suggest adopting group page style)
  * Search results resource link should link to resource page rather than url for that resource
  * Suggest we could tidy this a bit (e.g. have resources in mini-sidebar of search result ...?)

Data viewer:

 * Do not show failed preview with red-bar (esp when just empty datastore ...)
 * (? not really a fix) Give out a link as well as embed instructions (I often want to link to the explorer in a given state)
  * Should this link to the resource page or to a dedicated viewer page - cf # 2322 (resource sub-urls like /download, /api ...)
  * Do #2322 ...

Dataset page:

 * Put home page link somewhere more prominent (e.g. the top of the sidebar)
 * Make resources stand out more
 * Rename resources tab and heading to Data & Resources",enhancement,new,critical,ckan-v1.7,ckan,,,,ckan,none
