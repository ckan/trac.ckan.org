1623,Dump to exclude deleted objects,dread,dread,"The database dump currently contains all Packages and their associated objects, even those that have been set to state=deleted. We should exclude these from the dump now.

Dump = paster db simple-dump-csv/json

== reasoning ==

The dumps are designed for end-users to be able to run scripts on the mass of data. Since end-users don't see state=deleted packages then they shouldn't need them in the dump. In fact their presence in the dump probably confuses them.

Admins get the full database anyway in the backup pg_dump.

We only included them in the user dump because it was designed before use of state=deleted was established.
