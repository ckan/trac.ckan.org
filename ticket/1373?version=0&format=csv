It does however display the 'my account' and 'logout' link in the top right correctly.

Navigating to another part of the site (e.g. search or about or my account) does bring the 'add a dataset' navigation link back and the functionality works.

Works fine on test.ckan.net so only on thedatahub.

Not obviously a caching problem, since I did try clearing cache...",defect,new,major,ckan-sprint-2011-11-07,ckan,,,,ckan,none
