1608,Merge storage into Core,ross,ross,"As part of [#1574 Storage Changes] and http://ckan.okfnpad.org/newstorage it was decided to merge ckanext-storage back into core.

Other changes:

 * Remove /storage/upload page (we have frontend integration elsewhere now and we should also ensure that upload items relate to a resource or other domain object).
 * Provide a local path as well as remote path for form upload requests in API so that frontend can see url to CKAN path rather than cloud storage path ...
