2764	Simplify filestore	rgrp		"Definitely do:

 * Remove pairtree (and OFS) and do something very simple - make sure that filestore with local FS is very simple
 * 

Options:

 1. Local file only. Allow for uploaders to GS / S3 in the background 
   * Advantages: simpler, if local upload can do progress bars etc etc
   * Disadvantages: strain for web-app (upload a 2GB file what happens)
    * This is probably fixable ...
 2. Stick with how we are  

### New layout without pairtree

Each uploaded file is located on disk at:

{uuid}/{filename}

Alternative:

yyyy/mm/dd/{uuid}/{filename}

Need the uuid to avoid collisions.

Metadata: Store no metadata."	enhancement	new	awaiting triage		ckan				ckan	none
