1535	Plump for auth header of: X-CKAN-API-KEY	dread		"When using the API, the apikey needs to be supplied in a header called 'Authorization'. Because some proxys / deployments use this header for other things, a configurable header was provided as an alternative, with default ""X-CKAN-API-KEY"".

Rufus suggests having *one* way for this.
a) making this not configurable any more
b) making X-CKAN-API-KEY the default

(keep Authorization allowed, but not documented, for backwards compatibility)"	enhancement	new	awaiting triage	ckan-backlog	ckan			rgrp	ckan	none
