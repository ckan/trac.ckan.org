843,user list ui for group curation,wwaites,,"having the full names in the dropdown list of users is better than just the openid. however perhaps we should show the openid as well to distinguish between users with the same name.

is it possible to pull some default information from openid when the account is created? is it possible to redirect the user to the page where they should fill in their name right off the bat?

also the list is much too long. can we make it work some other way? javascript is an option, but must be careful to fail gracefully when the browser does not support it.",defect,new,major,ckan-v1.4,ckan,,,,,
