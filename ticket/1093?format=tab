1093	500 errors on GET to api/rest/licenses	dread	dread	CKAN gets its license list from a license service, which can be a local file, but is often the http://licenses.opendefinition.org/2.0/ckan_original server. This server is currently flakey, but I think we only request the list on start up. The problem is we query it much more often than required. It is queried for every request to api/rest/licenses, and we are returning lots of 500 errors when the license server is timing out.	defect	closed	major	ckan-v1.4-sprint-6	ckan	fixed			ckan	none
