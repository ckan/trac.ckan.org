1127,CREP0001: Formalise new feature discussion and definition using CREPs,sebbacon,,"'''Proposer:''' Seb Bacon[[BR]]
'''Seconder:''' Rufus Pollock[[BR]]
[[BR]]

== Abstract ==

When adding new features to CKAN, a longer, more formal discussion will improve software design quality and documentation, better engage
the wider community, and ensure the core team are up to date with
latest developments.  

I propose a formal process (CREP -- CKAN Revision and Enhancement Proposal) for making this happen.

== The Problem ==

The current workflow for introducing major new features into CKAN is
very informal, typically based around one person's great idea, which
they've discussed with one or two other people in the team.  The
originator of the idea is typically the only person with access to all the input they've had through such discussions.  Often, the only location of this information is  in that person's head.

However, there is a lot of experience embodied in the CKAN community
which should be drawn on before making large design decisions.  This
will lead to better software.  Additionally, building consensus in the
community around a proposal before implementation ensures positive
community engagement and buy-in to new features, making them more
likely to be a success.

We aren't great at documenting new features.  Documentation after
coding is complete is an unrewarding experience for most programmers.
Requiring skeleton documentation before code is written is a good
discipline that can form the basis of better documentation in the
future (e.g. by a writer rather than a programmer).

== Specification ==

Minor features don't require a CREP, and can just be entered in the
issue tracking system as a bug or feature.  As a rule of thumb, a
feature is major if it will take more than a day to implement, or is
likely to involve matters of opinion in its design.

If a feature requires a CREP, the proposer must first find a seconder
for their idea.  This sanity check step happens before a CREP is
written to ensure at least the possibility of consensus on the CREP.

Next the proposer should write a CREP, starting by copying and pasting
the [http://wiki.ckan.net/CKAN_Revision_and_Enhancement_Proposals template on the wiki] into a new Trac ticket.  This will be with a
CREP status of ""draft"" and Type of ""CREP..  The proposer should notify
the [http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/ckan-dev ckan-dev] mailing
list, and possibly the
[http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/ckan-discuss ckan-discuss]
list for less technical CREPs.

The draft can be discussed via email, verbally, or via the trac
ticket.  In any case, it is the proposer's responsibility to keep the
CREP updated to reflect the current consensus.

Once consensus has been reached, the ticket should be marked as
""accepted"" status and assigned to a CKAN release milestone.

When an accepted CREP has been implemented, it should be marked as
""completed"".

If no consensus can be reached on a draft CREP, or for some reason an
accepted CREP doesn't get completed, it should be marked as
""rejected"".

If a completed CREP becomes obselete, it should be marked as ""obselete"".

== Why do it this way == 

Given the distributed nature of the core team plus other volunteers,
some kind of written procedure is necessary to ensure a fully
documented and discussed proposal.

The idea of ""Enhancement Proposals"" which can be semi-formally
proposed and discussed prior to implementation is common in the Open
Source world ([http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0001/ PEPs],
[http://dep.debian.net/ DEPs],
[http://plone.org/documentation/glossary/plip PLIPs], to name three).

Existing historic proposals exist, called CEPs.  The proposed system
is called CREP (CKAN revision or enhancement proposal) to disambiguate
it from the legacy proposals, and from the delicious fungus ''Boletus
Edulis''.

Giving a formal structure to the proposal is useful as it gives the
community a means to identify a CREP that's not had sufficient thought
or discussion.  An informal email thread can easily be lost and
important questions (such as backwards compatibility) overlooked.  The
use of the proposed template empowers any community member to ask the
proposer to expand on rationale, deliverables, etc.

The structure chosen is somewhere between Debian's and Plone's.  It
aims to give a structure to the debate, a clear start at
documentation, and also prompt some thinking about implementation and
timescales.

Some projects (e.g. Debian) keep their enhancement proposals in a
versioning repository; others (e.g. Plone) keep them in an issue
tracking system.  Trac is proposed for CKAN because we already use it
for small feature proposals and for team planning.  It seems unlikely
that change tracking on an individual CREP will be useful; a CREP that
changes sufficiently from its original form should probably be marked
""obselete"" and a new CREP started.  Using an issue tracking system also
means we can easily track CREPs by state.

== Backwards Compatibility ==

Some [https://bitbucket.org/okfn/ceps/src/76b274888bcf/cep/ legacy enhancement proposals], called CEPs, have previously been started.

They are currently all marked as ""active"".  Any which require
discussion should be altered by the proposer to match the new CREP
specification and submitted to trac.  The original CEP should be
updated with a banner at the top pointing a reader to the new CREP.

Any that are now obselete should be clearly marked as such in a banner
at the top, pointing a reader to the trac for new CREPs.

== Implementation plan ==

=== Deliverables ===

 * This CREP, agreed
 * Support for proposed statuses in Trac
 * Canned reports for listing CREPs in Trac

=== Risks and mitigations ===

 * That this CREP is agreed, but rarely acted on.  This risk can be
   mitigated by nominating a CREP champion in the community or core
   team, whose job it is to say ""where's the CREP for that?"" and
   generally own the quality of CREPS

=== Participants ===

Once agreed, we need a CREP champion -- as yet unassigned

=== Progress ===

This document is the entire proposal.
