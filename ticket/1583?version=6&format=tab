1583	Integrate QA into frontend - 1d	johnglover	zephod	"Tasks:
 * ~~On dataset view page, add star rating after each resource view url. Probably similar to current format label after url.~~
 * ~~Add star rating to resource view page, along with a way of displaying the reason for the rating and tips to improve. Should be unobtrusive.~~
 * ~~Fix the table at http://thedatahub.org/qa/dataset/broken_resource_links - URLs should be truncated to a fixed not-too-long length and the other fields line up (eg by using a table)~
 * Handle 404s by showing that 'we think this resource is 404ing'.
 * Handle the absence of QA data on a resource (currently nothing is displayed. Maybe that's fine.
 * Do we need to integrate the 'reason for rating' string into the UI?

Next Steps:
 * Deploy CKAN and then CKANEXT-QA onto thedatahub.org to try out the code changes with real data."	enhancement	assigned	major	current-ckan-sprint-2012-02-06	ckan		qa		ckan	none
