668	Caching issues on API v1	Colin Calnan		"It seems like the API v1 on CKAN metastable (cset:ec21f8e1c87e) has some caching issues.

Steps to test:

1. Modify a dataset on datadotgc.ca, redirects to CKAN 

2. On save, redirects to http://www.datadotgc.ca/update/geogratisnat_hydrography_v100 which in turn redirects to http://www.datadotgc.ca/dataset/geogratisnat_hydrography_v100

3. You can see that the Dataset has not updated correctly. Run a check on the API v1 - http://ca.ckan.net/api/1/rest/package/geogratisnat_hydrography_v100 the updates are not present

4. Check the v2 of the API - http://ca.ckan.net/api/rest/package/geogratisnat_hydrography_v100, the updates are present.

5. Setting the headers to 'Cache-control: no-cache' or 'Pragma: no-cache' does not work either."	bug	new	major		ckan
