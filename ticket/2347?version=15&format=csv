2347,Related stuff dashboard and changes,ross,ross,"
Some additions to the related stuff functionality to make it more useful post the 1.7 release.

[\] My related things on my user page

    [x] Show user created related things on the users' page with links direct to the related page of that dataset. {0.5d}
  
__ Now makes the information available, but only the count is shown until we can get Aron /Sam to take a look at this page __


[x] Related stuff usage counts { 1d }

    Record the number of times the link for a related item is clicked.  This is likely to mean that the link fires to call CKAN and then redirects to the actual URL.

[x] Un-attached related items {0.25d}

    Allow related items to be created without being attached to datasets.  This may mean that the dataset field is optional in the API.

[ ] Dashboard for related 

    A dashboard for related items, site-wide (not package specific) and orderable by date, views, {rating}, popularity of the dataset.  Would be useful (possibly) for site-admin to mark one or more as 'featured'

    [x] Dashboard + Controller (Related) {1d}

    [x] Ordering at logic layer (date, views, rating, popularity of package, featured) {1d}
         [x] date
         [x] views
         [x] featured

    [x] 'Featured' related item with mechanism to fetch it. {0.5d}

        [ ] UI within dashboard for sysadmins to check/uncheck feature status {0.5d}

[ ] Changing auth for related.

    Currently auth is based on deletion being possible by dataset owner and the related owner but it may be that a lot of the auth for related items should be configured to have more restrictive auth.

    [ ] Document auth changes, allow for simple auth or this more complex auth in related.  This might be on by default for publisher auth? { 0.5d }

    [ ] Implement auth changes as per doc. { 0.5d }


[ ] General issues

  [x] Serverside validation of URLs

  [x] Activity updates

  [x] Make optional


[ ] UI Changes

  [ ] General tidy up, fix form etc

  [ ]  Highlight featured items py:if=""related.featured""

  [ ] Show either view count or popularity ${ related.view_count }
