use &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://leaflet.cloudmade.com/"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;â€‹&lt;/span&gt;http://leaflet.cloudmade.com/&lt;/a&gt; properly to generate map backgrounds for demo instances

            &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;status&lt;/strong&gt;
                changed from &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;closed&lt;/em&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;resolution&lt;/strong&gt;
                set to &lt;em&gt;wontfix&lt;/em&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
@ira,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'm just closing this
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
a) Because the ticket doesn't really mean anything what is &lt;tt&gt;properly&lt;/tt&gt; also a link to some random website does not help.  The ticket should tell me exactly what is wanted not be some sort of treasure hunt.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
b) This is major feature creep - we have agreed the tickets for phase 3 small things/bug fixes are fine but this possibly a massive thing.  For weird stuff like this maybe you should save them up for when we have a meet up.  You need to get buy-in from developers I need to have some sort of pride in what I do.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
c) I don't think this is a good idea from a technical perspective - maybe if you create a meaningful ticket it may make more sense.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
d) Also I'm not doing anything involving maps till we have proper attribution of the map we are using on the demo site because I have morals, I thought okfn did too but I'm not sure any more.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sorry to have to do this but it is for my sanity.  As I have repeatedly said the tickets are really important as they are the basis of all the work that I do.  They need to be of a reasonable standard.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I added this post discussion about attribution. Sam says that if we actually use the app itself (currently we're using the maps from it - but primarily by taking screenshots instead of actually integrating) then the attribution would automatically show.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In terms of ticket creating, I added this so people could see it and have a think about whether it's phase 3 or phase 4 (&amp;amp; move where necc) &amp;amp; whether you wanted more detail from me etc or whether it needed to be a more generic kind of ticket (i.e. 'need some low cost / low maintenance way to create backgrounds for demos').
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In future, shall I email instead? Call on skype? IRC? before any tickets are created?
&lt;/p&gt;

@ira,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'm happy to discuss things on irc/email if you are unsure about things.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If There are tickets that you are not sure about when they are wanted, then add them to phase 4 as they can then be ignored for now - anything added to phase 3 is a "this needs doing now" thing and as we have agreed exactly what we are doing in this phase (last week) then adding new features will likely get a negative reaction.  So if not sure add it to phase 4 - aron and I may do some phase 4 tickets if we feel they will be quick and easy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As I've said small things like the breadcrumb is wrong on page xxx or bugfix tickets are fine as broken stuff needs fixing.  Sometimes it may not be clear how much work something will be or who the person who needs to fix it is - so just ask first.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The main problem with this ticket is that it is unclear what the ticket is about.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
cheers
&lt;/p&gt;
