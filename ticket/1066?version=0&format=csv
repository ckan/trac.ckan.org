1066,Default reader role too permissive,dread,dread,"The definition of the 'reader' role includes creating packages, which is too permissive for some CKAN instances (e.g. DGU). 'Reader' suggests only reading, so I think this role should avoid creating and creating.

Implementation:
* Action.PACKAGE_CREATE remove from default_role_actions
* Comment written, to describe suggested policy",enhancement,new,major,ckan-v1.4-sprint-5,ckan,,,,ckan,none
