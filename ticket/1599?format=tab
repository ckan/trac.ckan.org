1599	[contrib] Simple embeddable dataset count widget (esp for group count)	rgrp	rgrp	"Simple embeddable widget for use on 3rd party sites showing dataset counts for a given search query. Have a specific version just for groups.

 * Simple group count widget in JS for embedding in wordpress and elsewhere
  * Requested by several people (e.g Guo Xu from Econ working group). Already have something like this in CKAN JS for doing an embeddable search box.
 * All you need to do is do a dataset query over the API e.g. http://thedatahub.org/api/search/dataset?groups=economics and then embed in some html! 

Estimate: 30m (for someone who knows their jquery).
