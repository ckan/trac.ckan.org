2665	add dataset stages need to be form buttonable	toby	aron.carroll	"the stages snippet needs to be inside <form> so I can make some links buttons - eg stage 1 -> stage 2 I want to save the dataset not just move to add resource

if you can just move it within the form html leaving everything else the same - I can then add buttons and pass back for styling"	enhancement	closed	blocker	demo phase 2	ckan	fixed	demo-theme		ckan	none
