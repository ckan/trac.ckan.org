1454	postgres search code/data removal	dread	dread	"We made SOLR the main and only supported way to do CKAN search three
months ago (#1275), but I notice that we still have remnants of the
postgres full-text search hanging around:
 * model code (ckan/model/search_index.py)
 * table in the database (package_search)

db, (& db backups etc), so it would be good to get rid of them if we
are not using them. John says this can probably be removed
