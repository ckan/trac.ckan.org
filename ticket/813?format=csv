813,Add link to “Register new package” to the homepage,cygri,,"A link to the “register new package” page would be handy somewhere on the front page. As a frequent editor, I often go to http://ckan.net in order to create a new package. I don't want to hunt around for the link to the “new package” form.

The link could go into the bar next to “About / Statistics”. Or into the “More information” sidebar. Neither of these truly make sense, but it's a frequently accessed link and that's reason enough to put it somewhere onto the frontpage.
