352	Package notification worker - sends XML-RPC	dread	dread	"== As an ==

external front-end

== I want to ==

be notified (by XML-RPC) about package creations and updates.

== Implementation ==

 1. A message queue worker waits for package update notifications
 2. On reception, it constructs XML detailing the changes and PUSHes it to a configured URI.

Rather than turning the package fields into XML fields, the JSON dump of the list of package dictionaries will become a single XML parameter.

Config - in the CKAN config will be:

 * URI to callback to
 * API version to use (version 2 gives packages referred by ID not name)"	enhancement	closed	blocker		ckan	wontfix
