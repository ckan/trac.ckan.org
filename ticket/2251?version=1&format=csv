2251,Internal analytics for ckan.,kindly,toby,"Page views and Resources clicks need to be tracked.

Google analytics can not be used for ecportal so build something very quick and simple inside ckan.

 * Make javascript to make request to ckan to store clicks and page views.
 * Add middleware so these requests do not go through pylons and just store data quickly.
 * Add config option to enable.
 * Copy reporting from ckanext-googleanalytics.
