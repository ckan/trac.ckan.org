2347	Related stuff dashboard and changes	ross	ross	"
Some additions to the related stuff functionality to make it more useful post the 1.7 release.

[ ] My related things on my user page

    [ ] Show user created related things on the users' page with links direct to the related page of that dataset. {0.5d}
  

[x] Related stuff usage counts { 1d }

    Record the number of times the link for a related item is clicked.  This is likely to mean that the link fires to call CKAN and then redirects to the actual URL.

[ ] Un-attached related items {0.25d}

    Allow related items to be created without being attached to datasets.  This may mean that the dataset field is optional in the API.

[ ] Dashboard for related 

    A dashboard for related items, site-wide (not package specific) and orderable by date, views, {rating}, popularity of the dataset.  Would be useful (possibly) for site-admin to mark one or more as 'featured'

    [x] Dashboard + Controller (Related) {1d}

    [ ] Ordering at logic layer (date, views, rating, popularity of package, featured) {1d}
         [ ] date
         [x] views
         [ ] rating?   
         [ ] featured

    [ ] 'Featured' related item with mechanism to fetch it. {0.5d}

        [ ] UI within dashboard for sysadmins to check/uncheck feature status {0.5d}

[ ] Changing auth for related.

    Currently auth is based on deletion being possible by dataset owner and the related owner but it may be that a lot of the auth for related items should be configured to have more restrictive auth.

    [ ] Document auth changes, allow for simple auth or this more complex auth in related.  This might be on by default for publisher auth? { 0.5d }

    [ ] Implement auth changes as per doc. { 0.5d }"	enhancement	new	awaiting triage	ckan-sprint-2012-05-15	ckan		[6d]		ckan	none
