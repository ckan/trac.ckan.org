335	Post-package-edit redirect to configurable URL	dread	dread	"== As a ==

third-party interface to a CKAN instance

== I want to ==

link to CKAN's package creation/editing pages. On 'commit', have the user redirected back to a URL in my interface that I can control. Also, when the package is created new, I need to be told what the new package's name is on return.

== Design ==

1. The 'return URL' is passed as a parameter to CKAN.
2. CKAN substitutes the package name into the return URL.
 
== Example ==

Front-end links to:
!http://ca.ckan.net/package/new?return_to=http://datadotgc.ca/dataset/<NAME> (but with the parameter URL-encoded)

When finished editing and the user commits, CKAN redirects the user to: !http://datadotgc.ca/dataset/pollution_data"	enhancement	new	blocker	v1.1	ckan
