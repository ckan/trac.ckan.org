908	Issues deploying extensions with modwsgi	rgrp	rgrp	"Some extensions import pylons features (such as request) at root.

Have encountered following issues:

1. You need to import ckanext before any ckan stuff in your wsgi script

2. Running under wsgi daemon mode (normal mode is fine!) the front page (front page only) will not work. You get errors like this in the log:

{{{
