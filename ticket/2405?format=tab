2405	Improvements to data viewer embed	rgrp	icmurray	" * Decent powered by icon for the Embed for the DataHub? (make this text customizable and allow html ...)
   * Current icon and text looks really bad
 * Embed link uses uuid rather than dataset name (this goes to perma-url question ...)
 * Data viewer embed url includes all the resource info (not needed -- just url and backend info ...)
 * Embed extension urls do not respect original domain but instead use site_url (I'm guessing). E.g. datahub.io domain ends up with links to embed on thedatahub.org
