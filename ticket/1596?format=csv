1596,Refactor authz roles,dread,,"Suggestions from rgrp:

 * Get rid of Roles, and replace them with direct assignment of actions, even though there are many actions, and extensions can add arbitrary ones.
 * Debatable whether we should cut the number of actions to correspond to the three roles defined by the base system.
 * Have a method of finding roles (or, in future, actions) relevant to a given protection object (e.g. FILE-UPLOAD(ER) not relevant to Packages)
