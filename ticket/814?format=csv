814,Have an “About CKAN” link on every page,cygri,,"A link “About CKAN” pointing to http://ckan.net/about should be visible on every page. This is important because people often land on subpages and may have trouble figuring out what CKAN is.

I would put this link into the main navigation bar, on the very right next to “Revision History”. Then I would also remove the “Home” item from the main navigation bar because it is redundant. The CKAN logo is already a link to the homepage. The only other subpage in the “Home” section is “Statistics” and that's already linked from the homepage sidebar.

But anywhere else would be fine as well.",requirement,closed,awaiting triage,ckan-v1.3,ckan,fixed,,,,
