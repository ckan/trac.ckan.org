1167	Create a standard CKAN system image for Amazon EC2 (AMI)	nils.toedtmann		"We should create a public AMI with CKAN pre-installed and configured such that users can easily create their own EC2 machine with a running CKAN to play with.

There are three phases:
 1. [nils] Deploy an empty EC2 instance to become the CKAN image master instance
 2. Install a CKAN and give it a standard configuration.
 3. [nils] Create a AMI from the CKAN image master instance and publish it.

I am happy to do first and last. Who is installing and configuring CKAN?

Unfortunately AMIs are specific to region, architecture and storage type. We cannot maintain too many images, so a number of choices have to be made:
 * Which distribution/version? '''Ubuntu 10.04 LTS'''
 * Which architecture/instance-type? I suggest 64-bit/t1.micro
 * Which region? I suggest us-east-1 and maybe eu-west-1
 * Which storage type? '''EBS''' (way easier to make an AMI from than instance-store)
 * Install CKAN from deb packages via mercurial/virtualenv? I assume the latter because the AMI is targeted to developers?
