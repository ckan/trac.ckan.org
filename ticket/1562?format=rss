    <title>CKAN: Ticket #1562: Finish Geo Spatial</title>
    <link>http://localhost/ticket/1562</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;
Estimated 4 weeks of Adria's time. I guess this will need to be broken down into more tickets. This feature is being requested by a number of potential customers and we have some ideas of requirements between Rufus and Jilly for this. This is the most popular new feature we talk about to new clients.
&lt;/p&gt;
