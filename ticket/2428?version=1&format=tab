2428	Reduce/sort out CKAN's dependencies	seanh	seanh	"This ticket depends on #2423, #2424, #2425, #2426 and #2427.

- Try to remove as many of CKAN's dependencies as possible

- Try to update as many of the remaining ones as possible

- Try to get rid of some dependencies that are fetched from random
  hg or git servers instead of pypi

- Then try to get the order of deps in the requirements files right
  so that you end up with the right versions of everything

- Each module in the dependencies file should specify the exact
  version, to protect us from changes due to them upgrading versions
  under us and breaking things or changing their own deps

- Consider shipping dependencies with ckan instead of pip installing
  them?

- This is related to moving CKAN to Ubuntu 12.04

- Add a test case that runs pip freeze and tests that all the right
  versions of deps are installed?
