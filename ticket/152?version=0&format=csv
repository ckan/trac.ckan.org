{{{
Key           Value            delete
[ country   ] [ uk, spain   ]  [x]
}}}

When presenting the form, existing pairs and 3 blank pairs are provided.

When saving the data, keys that are not changed use the existing PackageExtra object (perhaps with new value). Deleted keys put the PackageExtra state to deleted. For new keys, only create a new PackageExtra if there isn't a state=deleted one to resurrect.

Validators ensure no repeated keys.",enhancement,new,major,v0.11,ckan,,,,,
