220	UI Review - Package read	dread	nickstenning	"Package page [/package/mypackagename]
 * Design
  * In general: a huge amount of visual and typographic noise: ""Package:"" is redundant.
  * ""{edit}"", ""{history}"" -- ugly, and it's not clear that these are primary actions on this page. Notably, why on earth is ""make an enquiry with Is It Open?"" bigger than these?
  * Openness/downloadability icons: need help, as discussed earlier
  * ""Rating:"" redundant, as is the second set of stars -- why can't both the display and rate widget
    * Rating - alternative to GET on set_rating.
  * ""Metadata:"" technospeak, probably redundant.
  * <li> bullets add nothing.
  * Title, Version, URL can probably go in one line.
  * Resources can be made more prominent.
  * Author, author email and Maintainer, maintainer email can be merged.
  * Groups, tags in little boxes?
  * Notes made more delineated -- Markdown has the capacity to look like other parts of the page: perhaps monospace the typeface?
  * Don't show extras unless there are any.
