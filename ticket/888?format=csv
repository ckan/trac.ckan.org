888,Improvements to the dataproxy and the data API,rgrp,johnglover,"First version of dataproxy and data API working (ticket:698) but have identified a variety of important improvements. (Should split these into sub-tickets ...):

For dataproxy:

  * Testing for dataproxy
    * Can start by using known good remote urls (moving forward could switch to providing/mocking these locally)
  * Remove content-lenght for csv requirement: just read the first x rows (up to some configurable maximum)
  * Google docs style row/column selections
  * Use the swiss library - https://bitbucket.org/okfn/swiss
    * Support google docs spreadsheets (format = service/gdocs/ccc or gdocs/ccc or gdocs/spreadsheet)
  * Handle redirects for content-length?
  * Ignore resource type if not recognized and fall-back to trying to identify from extension (or mime-type?)

For dataapi:

  * Ensure we pass on resource format as part of redirect i.e. /api/data/{id} -> {dataproxy}?url={resource-url}&type={resource-type}",enhancement,closed,major,ckan-sprint-2011-10-28,ckan,fixed,,,ckan,none
