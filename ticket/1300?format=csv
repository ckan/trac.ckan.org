 * page_heading
 * side bar menu must be switchable (left to right) (through config or css)
 * Add optional_footer to complement optional_head
  * And adopt rule for template writers that all extra js must go in optional footer
  * That way we could move optional js to the bottom of the page to improve page load times.
 * Re-add support for body-class ... (seems to be removed by #1108)
 * more divs.
 * better labelling for css (and javascript)",enhancement,closed,major,ckan-sprint-2011-11-07,ckan,fixed,refactor,,ckan,none
