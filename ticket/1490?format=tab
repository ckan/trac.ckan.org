1490	Standardize output from package listings coming from the logic layer	amercader	amercader	"Right now, the two logic functions that return a list of packages (package_search [1] and group_packages_list [2])use custom functions to generate the output dict. That's suboptimal because:
- The template function that renders the package listing (package_list_from_dict) could end up receiving different dicts.
- Not all package properties are available at the template level (e.g extras, tags...). These can be really useful to customize the listing from an extension.

In general only the functions present in lib/dictization/model_dictize.py should be used to build the output of a logic function, in that case package_dictize. If necessary, they can be modified to include missing properties, like on this particular case the ""isopen"" property, needed by the template renderer.
