330	getdata/ons timezone not recognised on non-British servers	dread	dread	"The python time module is supposed to recognise timezones such as 'UTC', 'GMT' and 'BST' using the %Z parameter. This works fine on British installs, but the buildbot (for example) gives this error:

DateConvertError: Could not read date as ISO format ""%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S %Z"". Date provided: ""Mon, 04 Jan 2010 09:30:00 BST""

It turns out that it only recognises local names of timezones.

The ONS import doesn't care much about timezone, so we should just ignore it, avoiding these problems."	defect	closed	critical		ckan	fixed
