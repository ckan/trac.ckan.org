1. go to edit a resource, e.g. http://s031.okserver.org:2375/dataset/ted/resource_edit/a621a6ad-6f1c-46d1-b858-03cdb7a25c07
2. Change the format field to something it doesn't get. e.g. add a comma ""HTML,""
3. Get message: ""The form contains invalid entries:
Last modified: Date format incorrect
Size: Invalid integer""
4. Format field reverts, try to re-save/submit form - i.e. click on ""update resource""
5. nothing happens (same if you even try changing the format field",enhancement,new,awaiting triage,demo phase 2,ckan,,demo-theme,,ckan,none
