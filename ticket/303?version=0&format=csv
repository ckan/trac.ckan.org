303,"Package history & feed to show changes to tags, extras and resources",dread,johnbywater,"Currently a package's history page (/package/history/xyz) and related feed only shows changes to the core package i.e. ones which create a PackageResource. This doesn't include changes to tags, extras and resources. These need to be added.

There is the complication that the 'diff' function doesn't currently work beyond PackageResource. Unless this is quick and simple to fix, I suggest we let the diff remain slightly broken for now.",defect,new,awaiting triage,v1.0,ckan,,,,,
