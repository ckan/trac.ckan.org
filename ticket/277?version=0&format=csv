277,Settings WUI,dread,rgrp,"== Use case ==

As a ckan administrator I want to easily change options about the CKAN install.

== Implementation ==

Provide a WUI to edit the options. It is intended that the pylons config file can also be used to set these options if the user wishes.

Potential options to show in WUI:

 * Default Schema (e.g. default, uk government, others)
 * Search caching (on/off)
 * License service URL
