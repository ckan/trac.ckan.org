1682	[super] Translatability for EC	dread	dread	"We need to be able to translate:
 * EC extension (templates, form)
   * Currently the pot file is just for CKAN core. New pot file for CKAN core and this extension? Or separate ones for extensions?
 * Field values in taxonomy (e.g. country names - Eurovoc)
   * #1665 Research into Eurovoc
   * Display Taxonomy in different languages
 * Field values not in taxonomy (e.g. title & description)
   * Use extra fields e.g. _i18n_title_fr = Le data.
   * (If lots of fields would need translating then would consider having a new package for each language, linked together with PackageRelationships. But I think it is just title and description (resource description etc. are so minor, not worth translating?), so using extra field better.)

Timescale to complete this - Mar/Apr.
