1659	Cannot logout if CKAN mounted at non-root url	dread	dread	"If you set WSGIScriptAlias to mount CKAN at a URL other than / then you cannot logout without adjusting the OpenID logged_out_url to match in who.ini config. e.g.

 [plugin:openid]
 ...
 logged_out_url = /sub/dir/user/logged_out

Note: all the other URLs in who.ini should not have the /sub/dir/ - it is just this one that doesn't take account of the mounting point.

The solution is to fix-up the repoze.who OpenID plugin to take account of the mounting point."	defect	closed	minor	ckan-sprint-2012-01-23	ckan	fixed			ckan	none
