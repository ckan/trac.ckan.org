    <title>CKAN: Ticket #2989: "Add dataset to organization" should auto-select the organization</title>
    <link>http://localhost/ticket/2989</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;
'Add dataset to organization' button, when you get through to the third stage of the new dataset form the organization you came from is not selected.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don't see any option to choose the group when adding or updating a dataset, but if I add a dataset via the "Add dataset to group" button on a group's page, then the dataset seems to get added to that group. (And I can also add/remove existing datasets by editing the group.) I wonder if organizations should work the same way, instead of having an Organization drop-down when creating or updating a dataset. The add dataset page needs to somehow indicate that you're adding a dataset to a certain group or organization though, doesn't currently.
&lt;/p&gt;
