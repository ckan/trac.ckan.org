Is it possible to get the tagline text to float  the other way

at the moment we have

...........Title
Tag line to here

I'd like 

...........Title
...........Tag line to here

is this possible or too much pain

A minor problem visible on the home page
<http://s031.okserver.org:2375/> and other pages, when viewing in both
Chrome and Firefox:

if the browser width is not very wide, the tag line 'Open source data
portal' vanishes off the *left* hand side of the screen. For some
reason the browser doesn't even recognise this with a horizontal
scroll bar (as it does when stuff is off the *right* hand side) - it
just chops off the text.",enhancement,closed,awaiting triage,demo phase 3,ckan,fixed,,,ckan,none
