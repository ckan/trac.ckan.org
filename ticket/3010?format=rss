    <title>CKAN: Ticket #3010: Pin images don't appear in data explorer</title>
    <link>http://localhost/ticket/3010</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;
When minified files are in use (set debug = false in ini file) the pin images for points don't show up in the data explorer map view when viewing a resource with geolocation data.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
set debug = true will fix the problem by using unminified files instead but also turns on a bunch of debug stuff you wouldn't want on a production site.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
middleware.py, around line 73, is where the decision to turn minified files on or off based on the debug setting is made. This can be hacked on a production site to run with unminified files but otherwise run on production mode thereby getting around the issue with the pins. But that doesn't fix the underlying bug.
&lt;/p&gt;
