961,"Refactoring of forms, validation and model synchronization",rgrp,sebbacon,"This is a meta-ticket to hold all of the work on refactoring forms, validation and model-synchronization in CKAN.

ckan-dev thread: http://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/ckan-dev/2011-January/000180.html

== The Issue ==

From #926:

The current formalchemy setup conflates view, controller and model code in a way that makes it hard to debug and customise.

From http://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/ckan-dev/2011-January/000181.html:

... !FormAlchemy, in retrospect, was probably a mistake as it merges too much model/validation/form generation into one thing.

At least 3 functions involved [in this area]:

 1. Generating (or just filling) a form template with 'form data' (and errors)
 2. Converting model data to form data (also happens for APIs in fact) -- let's call this 'dict-ization'
 3. Converting form data to model data (and validating) (inverse of previous step)

== Related Tickets ==

 * #926 - Pick a simpler form framework
 * [not ticketed yet] 'dictization' - serialization / deserialization of package (and other domain objects) to standard intermediate format such as json-convertable python dict
  * cf existing dumper and importer code
  * This will fix #662
 * [not ticketed yet] - validation layer (should work on serialized objects?)
 * #662 - Can't put entity that is returned by posting to package register (Defect)
