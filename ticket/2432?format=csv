2432,Draft new trac methodology,seanh,seanh,"We want a new way of working with trac tickets and milestones etc:

- We will have a single queue of tickets, ordered by priority, that we all work on

- Tickets only get into the queue after triaging (which the devs do at regular intervals), so we and others can use new trac tickets as a dumping ground for any and all CKAN bugs and ideas without messing up the priority queue. Therefore the priority queue needs to be a special CKAN milestone or something. The devs need to regularly go through the inbox of untriaged tickets and triage them all, moving them all out of the inbox.

- Will we also assign tickets from the priority queue to individual devs in sprint planning meetings like we currently do?
