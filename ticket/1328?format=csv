1328,Unicode & paster commands,minspamboks@…,,"A possible bug in CKAN when I tried deleting users using ""paster --plugin=ckan user delete"" command.

To reproduce the bug do the following:

1. Create a user with an ID (which in my case was a user's full name)
that contains non-unicode caracters like Norwegian ""æ"", ""ø"", or ""å"".

2. Make sure that you can see something like the example below:
(pyenv) rm@mycomputer:$ paster --plugin=ckan user
Users:
name=Rustæm

3. Then try deleting the user with following command:
(pyenv) rm@mycomputer:$ paster --plugin=ckan user delete ""Rustæm""

You should now get a python encoding error. I know that this is quite
rare case, but in our case it caused some trouble. Could you guys have
a look at this bug?
