1506,"[super] UX improvements to dataset edit, create and search + group + user page (Dec 2011)",rgrp,zephod,"== Historical Parent Tickets ==
  * ~~Parent-ticket: #1450~~
  * ~~Parent-ticket: #1032~~

== Step Zero ==
  * ~~COMPLETELY REDESIGN resource edit process~~

== Dataset Edit-Resources ==
  * ~~Force format field to be lowercase~~
     * ~~Modify backend to serve it up in that format~~
  * ~~Subticket #978: Add extra fields to resources in Web UI~~
  * ~~Fix display of large datasets (http://test.ckan.net/dataset/europeana-lod)~~
  * ~~When submitting forms with errors, open the correct resource pane.~~
  * ~~No hint is given that the time format for a resource is in ISO, eg 2005-01-01T10:10:10~~
  * Resource description field to become the markdown editor we use everywhere else.

== Dataset Settings == 
  * Subticket #1648: Clarify edit terminology
  * Merge Groups and Tags into main Settings section (no point having them on their own and most people will miss this).
  * Fix (i.e. allow / show) name editing on dataset edit.
    * Fix the slugify so it does not overwrite if i change title after fixing name.
    * Make slugify encourage people to use shorter names. Either by cutting off (not so good) or showing a warning and saying something like 'hey you may want to cut this down. Hit edit to customize the dataset name now'
  * Autocomplete the author/maintainer box (requires API extension?)

== Dataset View ==
  * Fix animation glitch in expanding description
  * Can we make the list of files look more like a table? Lose space between files? Lose rounded corners?
  * Verify that there are no more (none) placeholder <td> objects (i believe they've been refactored out)


== Dataset Create ==

  * ""Upload or link data files, APIs and other materials related to your dataset.""
  * Include the description markdown editor again (keep it small)
  * Licence should maybe be restored
    * ""(Don't worry if you don't know what your licence is)""
  * Show the log message field
    * Beautify
  * Pre-populate the log message field?
  * ? Show Home Page field when creating dataset (+ show description (?) (-- but state that it should just be a few lines)
  * ?  Do some Guerilla UX to see whether we need to Redirect to Resources directly after dataset creation?

== Group Improvements ==

 * Minor fixes to dataset add on Group edit form - 0.5d - #1507

== User pages ==

 * ~~Improvements to user page UX - 1d - #1396~~
 * ~~Broken links for non-Gravatar use icons - 0.25d - #1719~~

== Etc ==
  * Take before and after screenshots
  * Write tests. You may not close this ticket without writing some tests for /editresources!",enhancement,assigned,major,ckan-v1.7,ckan,,ux,,ckan,none
