1380,Adding custom CSS could be easier,zephod,zephod,"While integrating the new theme and making a large number of UX tweaks, I've allowed the CSS file to bloat out of control with some very specific rules and subtle hacks, as well as a couple of clearfix <div> objects in the markup which isn't really good practice.

In general we want a logical CSS structure which is as easy to modify as possible. You should not find yourself being overwritten by highly specific rules all the time!

David Read sent me the following as background:

V. basic theming is described here: http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/theming.html

Deep customisation of the templates is done by creating an extension, with this as a template: https://bitbucket.org/okfn/ckanext-exampletheme/overview

That's what Augusto and the Brazilians have done http://alpha.dados.gov.br/dados/ and their code is here:
hg clone http://dev.dados.gov.br/codigo/dev/tema-ckan

Another thing of interest was us becoming compatible with Wordpress themes last December. Richard Pope worked with Rufus on this. I believe the base theme is 'twentyten' and I'm guessing that one would swap that css file with another to change theme, but I don't know. I don't know if this feature has been dropped since then.
