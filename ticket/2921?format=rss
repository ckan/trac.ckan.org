    <title>CKAN: Ticket #2921: Add docstring to top of lib/extract.py file</title>
    <link>http://localhost/ticket/2921</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;
I think it couldn't hurt for this module to have a docstring at the top
of the file explaining what the module is for. I know from setup.py that
it's there to provide the extract_ckan() string extractor function for
Babel, but I think looking at the file on its own it's not so obvious.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Also a couple of other small fixes:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
jinja2_cleaner looks like a helper function only meant to be used by
extract_ckan(), might make things clearer if it was called
_jinja2_cleaner(), just so it doesn't look like a public function the
module wants to export.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
jinja_extensions seems to be a module-level variable that is only used
in one function, could be moved into the function, unless you think
there might be more functions that want it in future.
&lt;/p&gt;
