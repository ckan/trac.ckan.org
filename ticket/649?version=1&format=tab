649	Introduce Authorization Groups in model	pudo		"Authorization Groups:
  * Rename UserObjectRole to SubjectObjectRole
  * Create database migration to do the rename in DB 
  * Make sure all the tests are passing again

  (Doing this first seems more stable since we first want to ""re-gain"" exisiting functionality) 
  
  * Create authz.py and model tests for authorization_group-based auth
      * tests: functional: create fixtures, do actual requests
                 lib-tests: test for membership addition, removal, group-right additions affecting all members, group-right removal, group rights affecting non-members. 
#  * Adapt model to get these passing
  * Integration into existing controllers should be negligible but may want ot have tests
      - do not want that. would mean design is broken 
  * Need to create a new controller for editing authz groups (will have same permissions as any other object -- Reader, Editor, Administrator)
