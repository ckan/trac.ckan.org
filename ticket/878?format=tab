878	Integrate file upload with workflow around package resources	rgrp	rgrp	"Create/edit a package -> add a resource -> Oh, i haven't uploaded yet, 'upload here' -> /upload -> standard upload form

Do we need to create a resource out of the file after upload? Do we sync file metadata with local Resource metadata?

If yes suggests (need to ticket):

  * 'ResourceExtras' for extra metadata on resources
  * Makes 'Resource' into first class object (and make available in WUI)?

== Depends ==

 * #877 (Upload in WUI) - should be part of that extension"	enhancement	closed	blocker	ckan-sprint-2011-09-12	ckan	fixed			ckan	none
