 * Rip the localised strings from the JavaScript source code. These are strings that look like {{{_('String')}}}, {{{translate('String') }}} and {{{ isPlural('String') }}}.
 * An endpoint that provides the translations in the correct locale for the user.
 * The endpoint should provide the locale as JSON (possibly using http://jsgettext.berlios.de/doc/html/po2json.html or similar tool)

The JavaScript can then read this file on page load."	enhancement	closed	critical	demo phase 3	ckan	fixed			ckan	none
