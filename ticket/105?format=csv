105,Package groups (view),rgrp,dread,"As a user I want to be able to create groups of packages.

This functionality is different from tags:

  * The ability to add a package to a given group is restricted whereas anyone can add a given tag to a package
  * Specifically groups have owners and only the owners can add a package to that group

Group properties
  * id (primarykey, uuid style)
  * name (restricted content - same rules as package)
  * title (no restrictions)
  * owners -- many:many with user object
  * description (markdown)
  * packages -- many:many with package object

Don't version groups for now.

Groups address in the WUI will be:
  * /group     - browse list of groups (reuse list action)
  * /group/list - same thing for now
  * /group/<groupname> - display: group properties with links to packages. No links to user pages (yet).

Group editing and searching will be another ticket.
