1576,Move stats extension back into core - 0.5d,rgrp,rgrp," * Remove lib/stats.py which is still in core
  * dread moved it to extension in https://github.com/okfn/ckanext-stats/commit/293b2544737d8ab7610884bd5e999ee37f1ab813 but did not remove from core
 * tiny extension with few dependencies - and really nice to have out of the box
 * Do we need tests for controller? Basic 200 I guess.
 * Documentation (?) - e.g. of basic config options
 * 

Est: 0.5d.

Questions:

 * Do we keep as extension (even if in core)?
  * Ans: Yes, keep as extension because:
   * Already set up that way
   * Cleaner
   * Easier to disable / enable 
 * How do we integrate with main them (e.g. have stats link)
  * Ans: not sure (this is part of more general issue of how we update theme for varying changes elsewhere). Best answer is to have some widgetization in theme.",enhancement,new,major,ckan-sprint-2012-01-09,ckan,,,,ckan,none
