1506,"[super] (yet more) UX improvements to dataset edit, create and search",rgrp,,"TODO: great smaller tickets

See also: http://trac.ckan.org/ticket/1404 (Post-v1.5 UX improvements) -- probably want to integrate with this and subtickets.

Note: dataset (and resource) view UX improvements are #1450 and #1032

== Dataset edit ==

  * Fix (i.e. allow / show) name editing on dataset edit.
    * Fix the slugify so it does not overwrite if i change title after fixing name.
    * Make slugify encourage people to use shorter names. Either by cutting off (not so good) or showing a warning and saying something like 'hey you may want to cut this down. Hit edit to customize the dataset name now'
  * Show edit summary form again, at least on edit pages (and prefill it for create to something sensible like: Creating dataset {title} {name})
  * Fix drop down for resource types in resource add/edit to limit to fixed set of options (as per http://wiki.ckan.org/Domain_Model/Resource)
    * See also http://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/ckan-discuss/2011-December/001860.html
  * Allow reordering of resources (or: and this is somewhat more complex but possibly simpler: allow editing of a resource_order field and we use that to sort resources (this is more like wordpress page_order -- these two options could become the same if we just hijack the existing position field on the join table and get rid of ordereredlist extension))
  * Merge Groups and Tags into main Edit section (no point having them on their own and most people will miss this).
  * Radically simplify set of licenses - #1359

== Dataset Create ==

  * ? Show Home Page field when creating dataset (+ show description (?) (-- but state that it should just be a few lines)
  * ?  Do some Guerilla UX to see whether we need to Redirect to Resources directly after dataset creation?

== Dataset search ==
  * Autocomplete  / drop down on search (i.e. search while you type)
    * A 'Nice to have' but quite a bit of work (and should be a separate ticket)
