1651,Explicit link mapper,dread,johnglover,"In this commit https://github.com/okfn/ckan/commit/1772a5c John Glover set map.explicit=True in ckan/config/routing.py.

The reason this was done was to avoid links collecting parameters.
e.g. if you were on page dataset/search?q=pollution then by default all the links on that page generated by url_for (Routes) would include the q parameter as well. To avoid this, you had to go through all the links and add id=None to the url_for parameters.

When map.explicit was changed to True, the value of the controller, action, id and any parameters were no longer automatically carried over into the generated links for the page. So previously links within the same controller didn't need to specify the controller (for example), but now they did. So when we did this we also had to fix up links that weren't explicit:
