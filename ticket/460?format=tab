460	State field changed by non-sysadmin	johnbywater	pudo	"This package:

http://ckan.net/package/dbtune-audioscrobbler

was:
 1. created by Richard (logged-in)
 2. edited by Richard (logged-in)
(According to the logs, at this point the state was changed from 'active' to 'deleted') -- RP was it set to 'deleted' or just ''?
 3. pudo changed the state back to active

Similarly an incident with bibbase package where field set to '' (see http://ckan.net/revision/diff/bibbase?diff=702bb0a3-03b7-49ac-87ad-e489c414962f&oldid=5447842d-b6ed-41d9-9cfd-8bb73b85c409)

Need to investigate how this got changed, fix if necessary and report back to Richard. Note that package 'admins' as well as sysadmins can change the state of a package (though note that bibbase did not appear to have an owner).

Suggested solution (for setting to ''):

  * Ensure in ckan/forms.py that there is a validator for state field that ensures only set to valid values.
  * Check that we do not allow state to be changed in the api except by package owner or sysadmin"	defect	closed	critical		ckan	fixed			ckan	none
