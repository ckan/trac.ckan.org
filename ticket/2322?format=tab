2322	Convenience offset on end of resource urls: /raw, /api, /viewer	rgrp	ross	"== Raw ==

/raw or /download (latter may be better)

{{{
/dataset/{id}/resource/{resource-id}/raw

=> redirects to resource url (download)
}}}

== API ==

{{{
/dataset/{id}/resource/{resource-id}/api[/....]

=> either redirects or directly serves /api/data/{resource-id}
}}}

== Viewer (Explorer?) ==

Do data viewer but without anything else showing (full-screen?). this would not be just the data explorer but other cases too (including iframe etc ...)

{{{
/dataset/{id}/resource/{resource-id}/viewer

Resource (pre)-viewer without anything else (perhaps include resource title)
}}}

Assigning for kindly for review.

These would take about 20m to implement and would be *very* convenient from my experience of using the data API.
