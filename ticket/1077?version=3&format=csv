1077,Switch to new vdm changeset model,rgrp,kindly,"Have developed a new ""changeset"" based model for revisioning in vdm. This has several advantages:

 * Much simpler
 * Cleaner separation of continuity from changesets
  * Supports certain operations that are impossible now (e.g. deleting all changes to a particular object irrespective of whether other objects were changed in same revisions).
 * Easier support for pending state and similar behaviour
 * No need to introduce new tables (and hence migrations) when making something revisioned (or not).
 * Almost identical API

== Possible Disadvantages ==

 * Difficult to query revision history. Currently we have a way of finding out the diffs of particular packages.  These diffs *include* changes to objects associated with packages (i.e a resource attached to a package).  With the new model the only way to get this information is by looking in the json stored in the change object which is very awkward.
  * RP: not sure this is true. You can query on object id very easily in the changeset model. Possible complication here is working out what objects are associated to say a package (e.g. have to look up ids of package_tags) but this does not seem more problematic than what you would do in other model to achieve the same ends.

 * Does not give us anything extra if we simplify our use of vdm currently. (see alternative below)
  * RP: not quite true. E.g. pending support and API.

 * A large change to database structure needs to happen.

== Implementation ==

 * The main challenge with this change is schema and data migration

=== Migration ===

Every revisioned object has a revision_id and revision attribute.

Approximate algorithm:

{{{
Revision -> Changeset

for revtype in [PackageRevision, ...]:
    for pkgrev in package_revision:
        changeset = lookupchangeset(package_revision)
        ChangeObject(cset, (table, id), dictize(pkgrev))
}}}

Question:
   * does pkg include tags attributes or not? or we have to dictize, pkgrev, pkg2tagrev, and tag. Probably the latter.

== Alternative ==

Instead of restructuring the whole of the database to fit the new changeset model just simplifying our use of the current vdm by removing stateful list/dicts and handling this state ourselves in the logic layer could be adequate. The vdm would then be just a simple copy on write mechanism at the table level.  This seems to cover all advantages/disadvantages above.
