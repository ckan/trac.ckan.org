1190,[super] CREP 0004 Data API and Data Processing System,rgrp,rgrp,"For some time (e.g. 1y+!) we have known that we want to integrate some kind of datastore / data processing system with CKAN. We've had a CREP in progress on this for some months (may copy that here at some point):

<http://bitbucket.org/okfn/ceps/src/tip/cep/cep-0004.txt>

We can distinguish 3 modules that are needed:

1. ""Webstore"": A datastore with dataapi - #1208

Suggestion is this would be sqlite based with a simple sql based API. http://ckan.net/api/data/{user|org}/{datastore_name}?q={some-read-sql-query}

2. Automated conversion of suitable resources into datastore upon resource creation so that e.g. they are accessible via the API. #1398

3. A data processing system which utilizes this datastore. One could
get a long way with simple javascript running in the browser for development with this javascript then run offline using something like nodejs. Alternatively one could allow one to specify a url to e.g. a python file which would then be run in a sandbox (with access to some specified set of python modules)
