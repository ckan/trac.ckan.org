Getting revisons by ID (on the latest ID)
 
GET ""http://test-hmg.ckan.net/api/search/revision?since_revision=44aac9b6-ba24-43a8-87a1-f6923dc523ff""

Returns a whole load of stuff (it's also quite slow - about 10 seconds)

I'm expecting it to return just an empty array - am I doing something
wrong here - if so could you clarify correct use of the API?


GET ""http://test-hmg.ckan.net/api/search/revision?since_time=2010-04-30T23:45""
Returns the empty string - I'd expect an empty array ie []

GET ""http://test-hmg.ckan.net/api/search/revision?since_time=2010-04-31T23:45""
Returns an internal server error 500 - I think it should probably be ""bad
Request"" 400 (the date is invalid)
