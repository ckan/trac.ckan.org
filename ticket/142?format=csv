142,Update User object with additional fields such as 'nickname',dread,pudo,"Suggested fields:

  * id, name (username/profile name), openid, email, password, extras (JsonType)
    * + current items: apikey, about, created)
    * current contents of name is usually openid and should migrate to openid field (could match based on starting with http://)
  * May also want a fullname field (or perhaps that can
just go in extras - may be better to have its own field as useful to search on this )

Related changes (probably separate tickets):
  * Improve user home page to include this additional information (and have it be editable)
  * Use user 'name' (username) for home page links (rather than current user/<id>)
  * Where we show lists of revisions, each revision author is now a link to the author's user page.
