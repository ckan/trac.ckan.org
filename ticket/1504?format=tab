{{{
curl http://localhost:5000/api/action/package_search -d='{""q"": ""osm""}'
}}}
The problem is the content-type is formencoding, the '=' is the first character of the request, and so internally the data_dict is set to ' ', which needs to be a dictionary."	defect	closed	minor	ckan-sprint-2011-12-05	ckan	fixed			ckan	none
