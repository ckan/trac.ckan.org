937,Record download stats for resources (extension),rgrp,rgrp,"As a User (especially as a Package Owner/Maintainer) I want to know how many times a resource has been downloaded (and when).

So let's record download stats (as in clicks on the link for a resource).

== Implementation ==

 * Use the existing support for this feature in google analytics or piwiki
 * For google analytics see:
  * Integrate to record: http://www.google.com/support/analytics/bin/answer.py?answer=55529
  * Accessing analytics data via API (for showing download counts): http://code.google.com/apis/analytics/docs/gdata/gdataDeveloperGuide.html
 * Limitations only record downloads by browsers with js turned on.
  * This is OK I think (in any case machine download via e.g. datapkg does not get downloaded)

=== Old Spec (do it in CKAN) ===

 * Record info of form: resource id (or url?), timestamp
 * Do this via javascript capturing of onclick event talking to an api
 * API: /api/resource/{id}/download
  * POST to increment (how do we stop spamming -- could use a nonce setup with a random string set on each page load for the js)
  * GET to get data back { total: X, day_count: [ [yyyy-mm-dd, count], ... ] }

== Questions ==

 * Do we record ip addresses (to handle de-botting etc)?
 * Do we count preview clicks as well?",enhancement,new,major,ckan-v1.4-sprint-2,ckan,,extension contributor simple js,,,
