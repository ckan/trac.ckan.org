2779,add 'deleted' to deleted datasets that admins can view,shevski,aron.carroll,"Currently, as a logged in admin, you can view deleted datasets just as if they are live datasets. Nothing distinguishes them apart from normal datasets other than they don't show up on the dataset page

This is potentially very confusing
Can we add some kind of banner / label to deleted datasets to show they have been deleted?

& Do you guys need Sam to design this?
