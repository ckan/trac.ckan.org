    <title>CKAN: Ticket #2986: Make lib/base.py more like it was originally intended</title>
    <link>http://localhost/ticket/2986</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;
From Toby: make lib/base.py be more like it was originally intended eg defines
stuff that is shared eg _ but maybe try to include stuff like
render/get_action if the circular import stuff can be solved - which should
be doable if hard and likely needs an extra file or two for the externals _
etc
&lt;/p&gt;
