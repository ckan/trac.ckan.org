377,API Should return JSON in all cases,glen@â€¦,,"When the API returns any response it should always retunr JSON. For example a 404 response should return something like

{{{
{'status': 404, 'message': 'package somename not found'}

}}}

When errors are encountered when creating a package: 


{{{
{'status': nnn, 'message': 'Validation Errors', 'errors':['description':'name cannot be
blank', 'description':'license code must be an integer']}

}}}

Not authorised:

{{{
{'status': 503, 'message': 'You are not authorised to create this package.'}

}}}

The reason being that screeds of html coming back in the response just makes it harder to debug and understand. Having the proper error codes/messages means that you can see why your package was not created.
