176,Package dependencies,dread,rgrp,"(Related to ticket:169 - Package derivations)

A 'dependency' relationship can be applied from one package to another. It implies that a package requires the download or existence of another package which it 'depends on'. (Analogous to software package dependencies.)

e.g.
london-traffic-visualisation depends on road-map

'Dependency' relationship is:
 * directional
 * many:many
 * stateful

'dependency' table columns:
 * id (primary key)
 * source_package (foreign key)
 * result_package (foreign key)
 * description (markdown text)

Further tickets:

 * WUI - package view - shows 'depends on package x' and 'dependent package y' with UML-like diagram of x -> this package -> y
 * WUI - package edit form - new option to say it 'depends on' or 'has dependent package' and you select the appropriate package.
 * REST api - expose reading and writing 'depends on' property.",defect,new,major,,ckan,,,,,
