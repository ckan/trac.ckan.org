907	Data previews: preview package resource data in the WUI	rgrp		"As a user I want to preview a dataset ('resource') before downloading it.

== Implementation ==

This will be implemented as an [wiki:Extensions Extension]

NB: This ticket requires a way to get data out of a remote url (the dataset). We do '''not want to put this data load/streaming into ckan core''' due to a) complexity b) load problems (do not want to take ckan out by accidentally pulling in a 1GB file)

  1. Need a 'data proxy' - see ticket:698 and ticket:888
  2. Preview using javascript in WUI - do this in an extension http://bitbucket.org/okfn/ckanext-dataapi
