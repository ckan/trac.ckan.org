43	Generic Attributes for Packages	rgrp	rgrp	"= As A =

User

= I Want To =

Add arbitrary named attributes to packages (an attribute being a name, type, value triple).

= Queries =

  * How complex is this to implement?
  * What would an arbitrary user be able to edit? Possibilities:
    1. 'create new attribute' and setting the value (so name and type would be chosen from predefined list).
    2. 'create', setting of name and value (but not type -- type already set in predefined list)
  * Could just use (machine) tags -- though this could be seen as a bit of a hack.
  * Would solve having to create special file/url attributes (though I think that perhaps file stuff is important enough to merit first class support in the domain model -- though, that said, since one won't want to have a file limit adding unlimited file support is very similar to unlimited attributes of arbitrary type)."	enhancement	new	major		ckan
