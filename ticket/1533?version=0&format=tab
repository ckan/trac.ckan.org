1533	Make sure ckanext-wordpresser works on CKAN 1.5.1	amercader		"The wordpresser extension does not work with ckan 1.5.1. The wordpress page is not loaded.

Looks like this changeset may be involved
https://github.com/okfn/ckanext-wordpresser/commit/0efa0649896a7339865f178a302be639ddc561e1

I think that even before that changeset, the page was shown without any margins.

In any case, the extension seems to be too sensible to changes in the ckan layout so perhaps it should take into account the CKAN version and have a fixed set of xpaths and templates that work for each version
