936	Watch / follow a package	rgrp		"As a (logged-in) User I want to watch (follow) a package, that is register my interest about a package. (Similar to watch/follow features in github/bitbucket/wikis).

NB: this is as much (if not more) about showing what packages are interesting to people as giving info to 'watchers'.

TODO: finalize terminology (github uses watch for repos and follow for users while bitbucket combines both in 'followers').

== Implementation ==

Become watcher:

 * Watch button on packages (if already watching say 'Unwatch')

Package-related changes:

 * Show number of watchers on a package
 * List number of watchers of a package
  * On a separate page (a la github) or on the main page (more like bitbucket overview)

User-related changes:

 * Show what packages a user has started/stopped  followed on a user's public activity stream on their user page
 * List watched packages
  * Either on user's page on a separate 'following' page. (NB: called 'following')
 * Does watching involve notifications (by email)
  * Probably not: you can already subscribe to RSS feed after all and email not that necessary (?)


=== Random Extras ===

 * What about following users as well
