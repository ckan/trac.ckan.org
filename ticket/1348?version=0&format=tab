## Edit Page ##
  * Hide upload if not logged in or storage not enabled
  * Make 'Add resource' links on edit page clearer and more button-like.
  * Move edit form tabs to the left
  * API placeholder text should not link to a CSV file
  * We used to autocomplete the format field - restore this functionality
  * Summary should contain 'name' (or, if unavailable, use description. Long term: description is to be deprecated)
  * [Done] Remove/move instructions where possible (a lot could just be placeholder text on the elements) (other stuff could only show on hover)
    * NB: reveal_instructions.js already disabled on edit page
    * [RP] have now done this on create -- think we can leave on edit
  * [Done; cset:755b1a622199] We have broken 'error' reporting for resource issues. Either need to move that into error summary or somehow not destroy it when we rewrite table on page load ...
  * [Done; cset:7ad090cb7855] Add slideDown to Resource expanded view 
  * [Done; cset:d3595143e506] Need ability to delete resources
    * No thought yet given to uploaded resources. Long term re-think probable.
  * [Done; cset:2430a68a59fc] Empty resource table to resemble view page (""no resources"" text)

## General ##
  * Highlight the package tab I'm on (view/edit/history)
  * [Done] Move script stuff to footer of page
