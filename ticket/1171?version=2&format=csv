timclicks: I'm looking at Dataverse for the first time[0]. It seems very popular in the social sciences. I noticed that there is a recommended citation for each dataset. For example, [1] is has this one: ""Targeted Input Programme (TIP) 2000-01"", http://hdl.handle.net/1902.1/SSC-MWI-TIP2000-01-M1 V1 [Version]""

== Implementation ==

Add a small box at bottom of dataset / resource page (or in sidebar on dataset page) with title ""Cite this"" with contents like:

%title. %author. Retrieved %date. %site_title.

For resource: %title = %dataset_title. %resource_name.

Could also add export to ref managers (e.g. to bibtex) but that is for later.",enhancement,new,minor,ckan-v1.7,ckan,,[0.25d] academia volunteers xsmall,,ckan,none
