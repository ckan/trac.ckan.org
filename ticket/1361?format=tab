1361	Simple search support	rgrp	rgrp	"Would be nice if CKAN could work out of the box without the need for SOLR (solr is great but complex and heavyweight to install).

Propose:

 * ckan.simple_search config option
 * If set:
   * query via simple query to database backend
   * do no specialized indexing

== Extras ==

Remove

  * TagSearchQuery from lib/search (just do a search directly)?
  * #1360: filter by downloadable and filter by open search options

== Possible Extras ==

(Probably future improvements)

 * Re-introduce full-text search indexing where supported in e.g. postgres and use for querying
