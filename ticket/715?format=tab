715	The group list page shall show the group title *or* group name	johnbywater	rgrp	"Symptom #1: Groups without titles don't get a clickable link, because there is no text. Defaulting to the group name would solve this trouble.
Symptom #2: Package groups drop-down list show's 'None' when a group doesn't have a title.

Therefore, we need to centralize presentation of group title, so it defers to group name. And we need tests.

Also please sort groups by title on group list page."	defect	closed	critical	ckan-v1.4-sprint-2	ckan	fixed	wui ux
