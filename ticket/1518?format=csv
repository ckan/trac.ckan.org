1518,CKAN Upload fails if filename has spaces in it,markbrough,rgrp,"E.g. uploading a file with spaces in it:
OECD Monthly Exchange Rates.zip

Gives a 404 Not Found response to the following file:
http://test.ckan.org/api/storage/metadata/2011-12-05T193046/OECD%20Monthly%20Exchange%20Rates.zip

The upload wheel keeps spinning and the user is not informed that the upload has failed.

Analysis: turns out that google storage (possibly s3 but not checked) replaces with ' ' in keys with '+' on upload. This breaks things because we try and look up metadata about upload using the filename/key we put in but of course that does not exist because google has changed name.

Fix is trivial: replace ' ' in keys / filenames with '-'.
