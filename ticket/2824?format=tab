2824	Multiple of the same Flag Issues	danieljohnlewis		"There is some bizarre language flag issues.
1) Log in to http://s031.okserver.org:2375/ (I'm logged in as danieljohnlewis)
2) Visit the apps page: http://s031.okserver.org:2375/apps
3) Have a look at the languages drop down, flags look fine (although Deutsche does have an EU flag rather than the German flag.. but that's irrelevant)
4) Change filters to, say, type: Application and sort: Newest, and apply. Web address becomes: http://s031.okserver.org:2375/apps?page=1&type=application&sort=created_desc
5) Look at the languages drop down: Flags are largely incorrect, with more than one country having the same flag.

Please see the attached screenshot.
