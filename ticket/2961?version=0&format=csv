2961,Preview plugin endpoint,dominik,,"Users could write ckan extensions that offer previews for a certain datatype. 

Advantages:
 - We can say that you can add your own previews
 - Every preview would have to define it's own dependencies
 - External development (community creates new extensions?)

Questions to answer:
 - Specification
 - Precedence
 - Plugins only define the datatype that they are responsible for or do we call a function that returns whether the extension is responsible. 

As far as I can see, this should be fairly easy to implement by following these instructions: http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/writing-extensions.html#writing-a-plugin-interface",enhancement,new,awaiting triage,ckan 2.0,ckan,,"iframe, preview, extension",,ckan,none
