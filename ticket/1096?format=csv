1096,[super] CKAN Hosted,pudo,rufuspollock,"Many users of CKAN want to have their own instance without much effort. Setting these up in separate places is a maintenance nightmare, we should much rather have some tenant separation in core CKAN. Some ideas:

 * introduce model.Site and c.site
  * site has: custom CSS, extra_template_path, title, languages list, package_form, group_form (all configured via web UI) 
 * Subdomain detector to activate sites.
 * use site in Authorizer instead of System, have a NullSite for global things
 * allow cross-site search
 * packages are in a list of sites, m:n rather than 1:n
  * list of sites is string-based, can contain sites not in site table to express harvested external material which is not editable locally. ",defect,new,awaiting triage,ckan-future,ckan,,deployment,,ckan,entities
