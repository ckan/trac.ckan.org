2873	ckanext-qa: Incorrect Dataset Openness Scores	danieljohnlewis		"QA Extension gives wrong score for Datasets.

This was found when testing on s031, but I imagine this is more widely applicable. It was giving a 4 star score to a dataset which contained a CSV file and an HTML link.

The way that I understand it is:

* 3 Stars: Suitable for CSV accessible over HTTP

* 4 stars: Datasets will have resources which are either RDF files (in any format: XML, Turtle, N3, JSON-LD), or are SPARQL API Endpoints, or are HTML files (either linked or uploaded) which are embedded with RDFa/Microformats/Microdata <-- requires mime-type analysis, and if HTML file then analysis of the doctype

* 5 stars: The resources will contain fully dereference-able URIs (i.e. their URIs are accessible over HTTP) <- quite difficult to automate, but certainly possible.
