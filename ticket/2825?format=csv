2825,Loss of URL encoding on language change on apps page,danieljohnlewis,,"Problem: On /apps page if you start in one language, filter the data, and then change languages it loses the correct format for the HTTP Get Parameters (and therefore loses the filters). Example, start in English language, change filter settings to to Application and Newest, change language to German.
Expected: Retain correct format for HTTP Get Parameters so that the filter settings are retained. Solution will involve not turning ""="" into ""%3D"" in the URL, i.e. turn off URL encoding.",defect,closed,awaiting triage,demo phase 5,ckan,fixed,,,ckan,none
