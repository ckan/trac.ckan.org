1312,Particular characters in JSON cause exception creating package on API,florian.marienfeld@â€¦,dread,"From Florian:
{{{
I am having trouble with the characters ""=&;"".
if they occur e.g. in the title of a package, I get a 400-Bad-Request
when I try to register a package by POSTing to ckan/rest/api/package

However, when I PUT the same package as an edit to
ckan/rest/api/package/existing_package, it works and the title shows
correctly on the front end and API.
}}}
