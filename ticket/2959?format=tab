2959	Changing a Group's name through the action api disassociates it from its datasets in the index	icmurray	icmurray	"Repro:

 - Create a new Group, named ""test-group"".
 - Add a dataset to it.
 - Verify the dataset belongs to the group by visiting the Group's read-page
 - Update the Group through the action api (group_update), using the uid in the ""id"" field, and a new name in the ""name"" field.
 - Visit the group's read-page.  The list of datasets will be empty.

This was an issue when editing a Group through the web interface, which was fixed in [1].  However it only fixes the issue in the group controller.
