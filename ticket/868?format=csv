868,Test improvements,thejimmyg,sebbacon,"The tests currently take 41 mins to run on most laptops. This slows down development and discourages a test-driven approach.

We'd like to see the tests pass in 5 mins or less (but anything would be an improvement!)

Some suggestions for achieving this include:

 * Upgrading the entire codebase to SQLAlchemy 0.6 so that tests could run against an in-memory SQLite database
 * Not setting up and tearing down the database so frequently.
