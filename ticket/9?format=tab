  * Full package registration process may be broken down into:
    1. Creating a package by provision of minimal attributes:
      1. name: unique and web-usable
      2. auto-generation of default values such as:
        1. date-registered (today's date)
        2. first owner (one owner should be created corresponding to the authenticated user performing this action)
      3. (?) auto-generate a default release
    2. updating the created package -> ../UseCase12
