1366	Search inside extra fields	dread		"SOLR search doesn't support searching for part of an extra field, but it does for other fields.

i.e. title=""One Two Three"" matches q=one AND q=title:one
and geographic_coverage=""England Scotland"" matches q=England BUT NOT q=geographic_coverage:England

This problem emerged when we went to SOLR in #1275 (CKAN 1.5a). Tests were skipped.

This is could be a problem for DGU and maybe elsewhere.
