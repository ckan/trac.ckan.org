1050,refactoring of ckan/lib/authztool.py,johnlawrenceaspden,,"start looking at ckan/lib/authztool.py

various administrative options are only available from the command line.

This file should be refactored so that the relevant methods are callable from code, in preparations for the creation of a web gui administrative interface.

The extracted methods should live in a new file ckan/lib/authz.py, called from authztool.py, which should do all command line parsing and printing.

Tests should be made.
