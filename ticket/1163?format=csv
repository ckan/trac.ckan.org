1163,Improvements to Storage Extension,rgrp,rgrp,"Storage is now working but there are 

 * Integrate with Resources (e.g. create a resource for each file upload and give option to associate with a package)
  * Should we introduce rule that files *not* associated with a Resource are periodically deleted?
 * Allow setting of a file name/path before upload
 * Allow for file overwriting/deleting etc (how should this work -- do we want to allow this sort of thing)
 * Integrate local file upload stuff in api/auth/*

== Different Backend Issues ==

Local file store is rather different from 'remote' storage in various ways:

 * For remote you don't want to use many buckets as there are bucket limits while for local you want to. Should we there have a single path that users provide which we then partition differently for different backends.
