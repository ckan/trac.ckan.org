1063,Groups listing widget on package screen shouldn't show group name by default,sebbacon,sebbacon,"I've been asked if we can do something about the overflow of the Group
name in the right hand column on this page:

 http://register.data.overheid.nl/package/europese-aanbestedingen

The reason is that the list display for groups is in the form
""group_tltie (group_name)"", and of course group_name can't have spaces
and so can't wrap nicely.

I was wondering if there's a good reason why we don't only display
group_title (if it exists) and group_name only when there's not a
title?",defect,closed,awaiting triage,,ckan,fixed,,,ckan,none
