176,Package dependencies,dread,dread,"(Related to ticket:169 - Package derivations)

A 'dependency' relationship can be applied from one package to another. It implies that a package requires the download or existence of another package which it 'depends on'. (Analogous to software package dependencies.)

e.g. london-traffic-visualisation depends on road-map

'Dependency' relationship is:
 * directional
 * many:many
 * stateful

'dependency' table columns:
 * id (primary key)
 * dependent (foreign key)
 * dependency (foreign key)

Further tickets:

 * WUI - package view - have list of dependencies (do not need to list packages which depend on this one)
 * WUI - package edit form - new option to say 'depends on' (no need for 'has dependent package')
 * REST api - expose reading and writing 'depends on' property.
