877	File upload in WUI (extension)	rgrp	rgrp	"Support uploading files to a storage system from WUI with a simple upload form.

=== Implementation ===

  * Implement as an [wiki:Extensions Extension]
  * Locate at /upload
  * Add new system action/permission (FILE_UPLOAD) and restrict by default to logged in users
  * Use OFS + boto -> generate form key (and create the bucket if it doesn't exist? Or do we assume bucket already exists)
  * This wants to be tied in to general package workflow. See parent ticket:852."	enhancement	closed	critical	ckan-v1.4-sprint-2	DGU	fixed
