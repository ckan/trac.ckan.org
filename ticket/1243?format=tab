1243	"[thedatahub.org] ""Upload Data"" should provide a nicer"	timmcnamara		"If someone who is not logged in clicks on ""Upload Data"", they are presented with

{{{
    Not authorized to upload files.
}}}

This is in emboldened red text. That is, the system is telling a user that they're doing something illegitimate, even though they're actually following an invitation from the main menu.

I propose two options for resolving this:

 1. only display the ""Upload Data"" tab if someone is authorised to upload data
 2. if someone isn't logged int, provide a nice welcome message thanking them for wanting to upload data, but we only allow registered users to do so
