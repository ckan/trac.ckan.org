1574,[super] Storage changes,ross,ross,"Allow uploading of files to push the data into webstore.  Initially we were going to suggest changes to ckanext-storage but after further analysis we arrived at the conclusion that this should be implemented by ckanext-archiver as it already handles archiving of data from various sources and would be the best place to 'archive' to webstore.

 1. A user wants to upload a file to CKAN, and so chooses the file upload option as they do currently with ckanext-storage. The file upload itself should be handled by this code internal to core (see #1608) but still using ofs [5d]

 2. The user is provided the link to the file as currently. 

 3. The archiver's update task will check configuration to determine if it should upload some mime-types (tabular formats) to webstore. Configuration should also determine where webstore is. (see #1609) [5d] - took 6

  * It should be stored in webstore using {username}/{resource-id} where {username} is the name of the user uploading the original file.

 4. The archiver will continue to move the file into permanent storage as per current practice.
