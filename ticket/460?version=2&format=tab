460	State field changed by non-sysadmin	johnbywater		"This package:

http://ckan.net/package/dbtune-audioscrobbler

was:
 1. created by Richard (logged-in)
 2. edited by Richard (logged-in)
(According to the logs, at this point the state was changed from 'active' to 'deleted)
 3. pudo changed the state back to active

Richard is not a sysadmin, so shouldn't have been able to see or change the state. Need to investigate how this got changed, fix if necessary and report back to Richard."	defect	new	awaiting triage
