283	Manage deletions of unwanted packages	dread	rgrp	"== Use case ==

As a user I want to notify the CKAN admins of a spammed or unsuitable package for deletion.

== Suggested solution ==

In the package view side-bar, there is a note: ""To have this package completely removed, contact the [ca.ckan.net administrators admin@ca.ckan.net].""

== Other solutions ==

A more complicated solution would be to allow packages to be tagged for deletion, which would auto-alert administrators, and allow easier administration of this. But this might be overkill.
