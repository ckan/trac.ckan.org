1667	Add an extension point for rendering activity streams	seanh	seanh	"Currently rendering of activity stream events to HTML works by looking up a rendering function in a dictionary that maps activity types ('new package', 'changed group', etc.) to rendering functions that take an activity stream event and return the rendered HTML.

There needs to be an extension point where extensions can register their own rendering functions for particular activity types."	enhancement	new	awaiting triage	ckan-future	ckan		4d activity_streams		ckan	none
