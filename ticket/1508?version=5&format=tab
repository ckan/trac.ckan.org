1508	[super] Finalize and deploy some of our major (new) features as of Dec 2011	rgrp	ross	"This ticket is about finalizing, then deploying (to http://thedatahub.org/), and finally announcing some of recent major new features such as:

  * Deploy wordpresser extension for thedatahub (so we can start blogging) - #1533
  * Deploy new Resource and Dataset pages (invite comments)
  * Get thedatahub geo-ified i.e. ckanext-spatial
    * Any additional dev that needs to be done? (e.g. geo in search ...?)
  * Deploy / re-enable ckanext-googleanalytics on thedatahub
    * Rename the extension to ckanext-analytics?
  * Custom forms (and use of 'dataset types')
  * Get QA deployed and running - #1594

It would be best if this was done by someone *unfamiliar* with the extensions so feedback could be provided on quality of install docs etc etc."	enhancement	assigned	awaiting triage	ckan-v1.6	ckan				ckan	none
