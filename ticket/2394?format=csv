2394,Separate off create_test_data CLI,dread,dread,We need to separate the CLI part of CreateTestData from the bit which creates test fixtures. This is because of the problem with imports and logging. Otherwise we have to do unpythonic things to get logging to work when deriving from CreateTestData from an extension such as ecportal / dgu. I've only introduced logging into CreateTestData but I think it is a good thing to have. This change doesn't cause breakages,enhancement,closed,minor,,ckan,fixed,,,ckan,none
