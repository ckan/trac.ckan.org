1405,You can add a package twice to a group,dread,dread,"To reproduce (from Jonathan Gray):
 * I go to add an item to the group
 * As I type, I get autocomplete options (cool!)
 * When I click on one, it adds this, and copies the same
autocomplete option in the box
 * When I click submit, it seems to add the item twice
 * On the main group page I think it just shows up once, but when I
click edit it shows two identical boxes, both ticked - and the count
includes two copies of the same item
