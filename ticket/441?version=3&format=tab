441	Read-only state for CKAN	dread		"When performing maintenance on CKAN it may be necessary to make CKAN obviously read-only, telling the users and restricting access to 'edit' pages.

Examples of use:
 * Administrator wants to upgrade CKAN or move it to another server. During this time the database is being administered and either edits are lost or can't be done.
 * A CKAN is used just for distributing metadata and so is always read-only. Updates may still arrive through direct db manipulation, e.g.:
   * another (but writable) CKAN instance is connected to the same db
   * restoring database dumps from another CKAN db
 * Should a security be breached, all editing could be stopped
