1574,[super] Storage changes,ross,ross,"Allow uploading of files to push the data into webstore.  Initially we were going to suggest changes to ckanext-storage but after further analysis we arrived at the conclusion that this should be implemented by ckanext-archiver as it already handles archiving of data from various sources and would be the best place to 'archive' to webstore.

 1. A user wants to upload a file to CKAN, and so chooses the file upload option as they do currently with ckanext-storage. The file upload itself should be handled by this code internal to core (see #1608) but still using ofs

 2. The user is provided the link to the file as currently. 

 3. The archiver's update task will check configuration to determine if it should upload some mime-types (tabular formats) to webstore. Configuration should also determine where webstore is. (see #1609)

  * It should be stored in webstore using {username}/{resource-id} where {username} is the name of the user uploading the original file.

 4. The archiver will continue to move the file into permanent storage as per current practice.
