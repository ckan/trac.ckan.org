1053,Deletion in Model API,dread,dread,"Currently in the API if you DELETE a package/group/user (and you have the required permissions) then it purges the object, when it should probably just set the state to deleted.

There is no way to delete objects at the moment - changes to 'state' are ignored in the API.

Do we need an alternative way to purge objects in the API?",defect,closed,awaiting triage,ckan-v1.5,ckan,fixed,,,ckan,none
