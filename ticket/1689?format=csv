1689,List deleted datasets in API,dread,kindly,"The admin extension allows deleted datasets to be viewed, but there is no equivalent in the API. The package_list API call filters to just 'state=active' datasets. 

'state' could be a parameter on the package_list call
 * Easy to call and implement
 * But getting permissions right for the different state values may not be easy - maybe a separate logic function is better?
