1674	Test auth logic hooks for publisher profile	ross	ross	"Super #1669

Also make sure that we have a test to compare the naming of the core auth funcs with the profile hooks (so we can see what may have changed in one but not the other)."	enhancement	closed	awaiting triage	ckan-sprint-2012-02-06	ckan	fixed	[3d][a:2d]		ckan	none
