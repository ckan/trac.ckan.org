2780	way for admins to undelete datasets	shevski	toby	"Since admins can see deleted datasets - there should be a way for them
a) to know they are currently deleted & not viewable by normal users - ticket: #2779
b) way to undelete such datasets - this ticket

I suggest a button on the edit form instead of the delete button
i.e. remove normal delete button with 'deleted dataset, only admins can view' with undelete button next to the message?"	enhancement	new	awaiting triage	demo phase 4	ckan		demo-theme	aron.carroll	ckan	none
