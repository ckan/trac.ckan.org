1152,True support for generic CSW servers,amercader,amercader,"The CSW harvesters implemented at the moment were developed with the DGU
project in mind, and they assume all remote CSW servers to implement the
Gemini 2 specification. Gemini 2 is the profile defined in the UK for
INSPIRE complying metadata, so obviously catalogs from other countries
or non-INSPIRE complying ones won't be able to be harvested.

The changes needed to support generic CSW servers (i.e. those
implementing the ISO 19139 profile) are:

* Handling the validators (right now are hardcoded in the harvester
code). This probably involves issues discussed in the CREP 3
(ticket #1134)

* Changes in the model to adapt the specification to ISO 19139

* Renaming objects and classes which are now Gemini-centric
