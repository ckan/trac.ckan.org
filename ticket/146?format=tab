146	Problem when an admin user logs in between commencing editing and saving	rgrp	pudo	"  1. Visitor starts editing a package (or creates a new package)
  2. Visitor logs in before previewing or committing
  3. Visitor is an admin (or sysadmin)
  4. Preview or commit fails

When you login the old form is now incorrect and this results in the formalchemy fieldset breaking."	defect	closed	awaiting triage		ckan	worksforme
