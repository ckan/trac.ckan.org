362,Ratings should not be created with a GET,dread,dread,"== Background ==

In the Web UI, when you rate a package it simply links to something like:

http://ckan.net/package/rate/mke-liquor-licenses?rating=3

This creates a GET request. 

This is bad because:

 * Search engine crawlers follow links to find pages, and in this case end up creating a rating (although we've got a robots.txt to try and avoid this)
 * There are occasions when we want to make a CKAN instance read-only, so we put a <LimitExcept GET> Apache instruction in. But the database may still get written for these ratings.
 * Best practise for web requests is for GET to be a read-only request.",defect,closed,awaiting triage,,ckan,invalid,,,ckan,none
