891,Resource download worker daemon,pudo,,"Write a worker daemon to download all resources from a CKAN instance to an OFS repository. 

== Open questions == 

 * Do we only want to download openly licensed information? 
 * Should we have clever ways to dump APIs? 
 * Do we respect robots.txt even for openly licensed information? 

== Functionality == 

 * Download files via HTTP, HTTPS and, optionally FTP. 
 * Respect HTTP/1.1 Caching headers: 
  * Complete support for ETags
  * Expires, Max-Age etc. 
 * Handle errors, classify as temporary or permanent
 * Respect robots.txt 

== Optional functionality ==

 * If result object is HTML, search for references to ""proper data"" (CSV download pages etc.)
 * Download from POST forms (accepting licenses or weird proprietary systems) 
 * Support running on Google Apps Engine to save traffic costs.

== Existing work == 

 * https://bitbucket.org/pudo/ckanextarchive - Old archiver extension, largely experimental. 
 * https://bitbucket.org/ollyc/ckan/changeset/1b16fbe9aa65 - Openness scores by ollyc",task,new,critical,ckan-v1.3,ckan,,,,,
