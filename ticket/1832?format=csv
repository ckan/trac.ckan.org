1832,dataset purge API,dread,,"Purging datasets (deleting them fully, not just changing the state to 'deleted') is important for users testing dataset creation over the API on a test CKAN instance. 

Without this, they need to resort to more difficult methods such as:
 * cleaning and reloading the database
 * setting the test datasets to state 'deleted' and also appending a suffix '_00' and incrementing the number until there is no clash of names.

Requested for NHSIC.

== Implementation ==

 * This could slot into the Action API. 
 * Of course we would need to ensure the user's had been given the specific right to purge.
 * I suggest we log the full details of the dataset being purged.",enhancement,assigned,critical,ckan-backlog,ckan,,,,ckan,none
