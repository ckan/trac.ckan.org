1401	Some links don't take account when CKAN is mounted at a non-root URL	flofokus	rgrp	"if you want your ckan to reside not at
http://yourhost.org/
but rather e.g. at
http://yourhost.org/ckan/
you can use this hint
http://wiki.pylonshq.com/display/pylonsdocs/Configuration+Files
and set ckan.site_url accordingly in your .ini.
However, there are some instances where internal links are created without the required prefix."	defect	closed	minor	ckan-sprint-2012-01-23	ckan	fixed	ux	augusto.herrmann@â€¦	ckan	deployment
