Etherpad: http://ckan.okfnpad.org/queue (most relevant parts inlined here)

== Preliminaries ==

 * Add task_status table to store qa/archiever/webstore information that does not need to be versioned. - #1363 (and #1371 - related logic functions)

== Tasks ==

 1. Resource change notifications in core - Make an IResourceChange and IResourceUrlChange. [1d] [0.75d] -  #1383
 2. ckanext-archiver implements IResourceUrlChange and sends tasks to celery. [0.25d][0.25d] - ???
 3. Archiver daemon #891
   1. implement link-check function and task (point 2 from Archiver.update above) [1d] [0.5d]
   2. Rewrite archiver to use external storage. (decide how!)[3d][~2d]
 5. Write to resource and task status table.[1d][0.75d]
 6. Make archived data available in WUI - #892

== Archiver process ==

Archiver:

 0. A resource is added to CKAN
 1. IResourceCreate event generated
 2. IF: resource url points to ckan storage or falls within some other set of exclusion conditions then END else continue
 3. Generate a Archiver.Update task with resource.id

Archiver.update: see #891

Link checker: same as Archiver.update up to 2.1"	enhancement	new	awaiting triage	ckan-sprint-2011-10-24	ckan				ckan	none
