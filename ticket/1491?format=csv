1491,Visible strings need internationalisation,dread,seanh,"Sean spotted that some strings need internationalising, such as flash messages. Generally all strings that appear on the web front-end should be internationalised.

Particular places that need i18n:

* ckan/controllers/admin
* ckan/lib/base

Note: there are some exceptions, such as in i18n.py, very obscure error messages and stuff that only appears on the API.

NB: there is a cost in making a string internationalisable (all our volunteers have to translate it), so we should not be too zealous. We should also look at the i18n/ckan.pot to see if any of the existing strings can be reused.",defect,closed,minor,,ckan,fixed,,,ckan,none
