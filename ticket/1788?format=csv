1788,IE7 compatibility problems,zephod,zephod,"From Antonia Acuno, via Ira:

It appears that the current layout for the datahub does not work in
IE7, which would mean a problem for us as most gov uses it and is one
of those we have to support...any views?

Tested in several gov departments computers, so a common enough issue.

From Rufus:
We haven't officially supported IE7 so far but can put engineering
effort into this if absolutely needed. I note that IE 7 is now 3y out
of date and is likely a security risk. Obviously this is something to
ask Antonio about.",defect,closed,major,ckan-sprint-2012-03-05,ckan,fixed,,,ckan,none
