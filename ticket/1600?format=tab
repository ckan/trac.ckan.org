1600	[super] User guide with integrated help in the WUI	rgrp	rgrp	"Provide help to users in the WUI, with this linking to a detailed user guide.

 * User guide (suggest at help.thedatahub.org (or possibly help.ckan.org)
 * Snippets in the WUI with links to full user guide.
  * Provide helper methods for creating these links with config options for setting path to user guide so that the link location can vary on install by install basis
 * General info about publishing/working with/etc data (where we don't duplicate elsewhere)

Est: (?) 5-10d

== Topics ==

See http://ckan.okfnpad.org/datahub-help

 * Step-by-step for adding a dataset including tips
  * Reuse: http://datapatterns.org/datahub.html
  * Quick overview of relevant parts of domain model (dataset and resource)
 * API (perhaps link to main docs)
 * Command line interface and dpm
 * Using groups

== Why do this ==

We already have wiki.ckan.org and docs.ckan.org. Why do this?

Answer for docs:

 * This is administrative guide and focused on general CKAN software.
 * Hard to provide completely generic help.
 * Integratable with the DataHub site

Answer for wiki:
 * No spam
 * General feeling that wikis are a little bit loose and untidy. We want this to be smart, clean and useful.
 * Integratable with the DataHub
