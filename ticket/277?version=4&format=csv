277,Settings in WUI (extension),dread,rgrp,"== Use case ==

As a ckan administrator I want to easily change options about the CKAN install.

== Implementation ==

  * Start storing majority of settings in db
  * Have editor for settings as part of admin wui
  * Settings are also loaded from pylons ini file on start up (or based on a specific command)

Potential options to show in WUI:

 * Default Schema (e.g. default, uk government, others)
 * Search caching (on/off)
 * License service URL

== Depends ==

  * Would be part of ckan-admin section and hence build on ticket:833 (Administrative dashboard)
