1711,Resource validation page,icmurray,icmurray," * On the resources tab, there's a ""Check Resources"" button which, when clicked makes an ajax request
   with the list of URLs entered by the user.
   
 * The server checka each link for errors and header information about the linked resource.  (Using
   ckanext/archiver/tasks.py:link_checker()).
   
 * The server returns a list of dicts (json), containing information about the linked resource, and
   the client uses that to:

     - populate the format field of each resource
     
       The (guessed) 'file_extension' populates the '__format' field.  If it's 'htm' or 'html',
       then we assume it's a listing page, and so don't populate the format field with 'htm' or
       'html'.
     
     - provide feedback if a URL appears to be invalid
     
       If the URL doesn't appear to be a URL at all, or returns a HTTP error, or times-out, then
       URL field is highlighted in red to indicate it's a bad URL.  A tooltip shows the
       error message to the user.
     
     - [Optional] provide feedback if a URL appears to point to ""Additional Information"" - ie the
       Resource should be entered under ""Additional Resources"", rather than ""Timeseries"" or
       ""Individual"" datasets.
