821,Some resources have disappeared in CKAN,dread,,"Simon has spotted 31 packages whose resources have disappeared in CKAN, but still appear in the Drupal front-end.

Here are the details:
 * in CKAN's package view (in web interface, API and dump) no resources display
 * but they WERE created in CKAN, as shown by the revision diffs.
 * they are in the Drupal front-end

So these resources must have been in the CKAN API at some point and then disappeared without trace/revision to alert Drupal.
