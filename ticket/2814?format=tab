2814	Demo: upload file behaves oddly	markw	shevski	"3. Uploading a file behaves counter-intuitively (I would suggest wrongly).

When adding a new resource by uploading a file, I select a file called
say create-group.png. I expect the following to happen:

 * the pathname of that file is filled in the box;
 * nothing is actually uploaded till I hit 'add' (confirming that I've got the right file etc).

Instead of this,

 * the file is immediately and, seemingly, irrevocably uploaded;
 * the box is filled with a mysterious URL (https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/ckan-demo ...)
 * the mysterious URL is so long I can't even see the final element, which is my file name.
