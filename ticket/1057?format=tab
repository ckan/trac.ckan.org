1057	JSONP parameter isn't escaped	dread		"{{{
$ curl ""http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/rest/package/annakarenina?callback=<script>jsoncallback""
}}}
gives:
{{{
<script>jsoncallback({""id"": ""c10ebd31-5b45-4f6f-885d-dca9b18caec4"", ""name"": ""annakarenina"", ""title"": ""A Novel By Tolstoy"",
}}}
which could run script code in the client who made the call.

One idea for filtering: http://tav.espians.com/sanitising-jsonp-callback-identifiers-for-security.html
Maybe just better to have a restricted whitelist of characters to be even more sure.
