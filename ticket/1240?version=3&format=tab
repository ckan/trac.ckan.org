1240	[super] API v4	rgrp		"(Just creating this ticket as somewhere to keep notes)

 * Tidying
  * Unify on /api/v{version num}/... structure (do we want a default option that points to current default? e.g. /api/default/ ...)
  * extras merged into normal field list in package
  * Get rid of /rest/ so just have api/v1/package
  * Get rid of separation of search api from 'rest' api
   * Propose that GET on REST index is search e.g. /package/?q=...
    * This is also resolves issue whereby GET at root returns whole package set (a *bad* idea) as this would now become the matchall search query (with a default limit on items returned)
 * Resource read/write in API (separate from package)
  * Does this need authorization work?
 * user/account API - read/write
 * Remove autocomplete -- can just use search
  * Do not worry about backwards compat as should only be used in our js (if others using it too bad!)
