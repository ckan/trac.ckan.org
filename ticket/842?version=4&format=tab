842	Todo list CKAN extension	rgrp	johnglover	"An extension that provides a todo list feature on CKAN so that people can register and find things to do.

Extension name: ckanext-todo

== User Story ==

=== Package page ===

As a user I come to a package:

 * Have a todo count at that top that takes you down to the todo list (which may say nothing todo)
 * At the bottom is a section of the package display titled ""ToDo"" where I see a list of all toDos for the package most recent at the top
  * If I am logged in 
   * See a form for ""Add to do"" at the top of the todo section and can add one straight away
   * I see a ""now resolved"" button next to each which goes green when you hover.
      When clicked the todo fades away.
   * Not logged in: I see a button that says ""login to add todo""

=== Todo list page ===

When a user comes to todo overview at /todo

At top list all todo categories with counts (or a progress bar). Click on category name or bar takes you down page to list for that category.

Category list has a list of todo items (ul with li items with class todo) - link to package relevant to the todo.


== Implementation ==

The Todo form

 * One of the fields is category -> autocomplete the category (not constrained) (lowercase, no spaces, .-_ allowed)
 * Add a description
 * Submit, the todo gets added via AJAX to the list at the top as the most recent todo

Model:

{{{
todo table

  id (autoincrement integer)
  package_id
  todo_category_id (required)
