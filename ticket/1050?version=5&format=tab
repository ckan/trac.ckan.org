1050	refactoring of ckan/lib/authztool.py	johnlawrenceaspden	johnlawrenceaspden	"start looking at ckan/lib/authztool.py

various administrative options are only available from the command line.

This file should be refactored so that the relevant methods are callable from code, in preparations for the creation of a web gui administrative interface.

The extracted methods should live in a new file ckan/lib/authz.py, called from authztool.py, which should do all command line parsing and printing.

Tests should be made. There's already a file ckan/tests/test_authz.py, which looks like the appropriate place for new tests.
