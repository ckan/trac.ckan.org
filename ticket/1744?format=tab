  * ~~Show edit summary form again, at least on edit pages (and prefill it for create to something sensible like: Creating dataset {title} {name})~~ [Done #1506]
  * ~~Fix drop down for resource types in resource add/edit to limit to fixed set of options (as per http://wiki.ckan.org/Domain_Model/Resource)~~
    * ~~See also http://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/ckan-discuss/2011-December/001860.html~~
  * ~~Allow reordering of resources (or: and this is somewhat more complex but possibly simpler: allow editing of a resource_order field and we use that to sort resources (this is more like wordpress page_order -- these two options could become the same if we just hijack the existing position field on the join table and get rid of ordereredlist extension))~~ [DONE #1506]
  * ~~Radically simplify set of licenses~~ [DONE #1359]
  * ~~""Unsaved changes"" warning briefly when you click ""Save"" #1735~~
  * ~~""Unsaved changed"" typo on dataset edit page~~
