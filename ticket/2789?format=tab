2789	logo fixups	toby	aron.carroll	"With the text logo I'd like the tag line to be under the site name so some css like

`float:left;clear:left;font-size:13px;line-height:0.1;`

commit daac54dbd856  I've added a new global g.header_css that sets the hgroup class to


'header-image'
'header-text-logo'
'header-text-logo-tagline'


I think maybe we should also have 'header-image-css'  for the equivalent of the class=""logo"" in the link to allow/stop the image replacement
