1680	Group refactor top level element	ross	ross	"The new group refactor allows for a hierarchy of groups where each group has a type - to be able to implement a tree of groups.

It will need a flag within the group to denote that it is a top level group, to circumvent the need to determine whether the group is a child of a parent node (for a specific use case - a publisher representing the department that only contains publishers).
