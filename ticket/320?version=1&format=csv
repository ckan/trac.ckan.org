320,site_title configuration variable which is used in template,rgrp,dread,"As a sysadmin I want to configure basic site title information for use in the site templates.

Implementation:

  * ckan.site_title config variable
  * set this on g in app_globals.py e.g.
    * from pylons import config; g.site_title = config.get('ckan.site_title, 'CKAN - Comprehensive Knowledge Archive Network')
  * use in head title and in main site title/logo section (use it as alt on logo image)
  * Also all other pages (e.g. index, about) which talk about CKAN
    * Is this needed? Would it not be better for people who want to customize the site to simply overwrite those templates?

Questions:
  * Do we want a site_logo variable whic his use for site title/logo section instead of site_title if site_logo defined?
  * Probably yes, but '''not''' part of this ticket.",enhancement,new,major,v1.1,ckan,,,,,
