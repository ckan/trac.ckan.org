1099	strange interactions between two browsers while playing with authz groups	johnlawrenceaspden		"While playing with the authorization groups, trying to design tests, I found that it was necessary to log in as two different users with two different browsers. Often actions of one user would cause server errors in the other user's browser.

I don't have a reproducible test case, but it happens fairly often so it shouldn't be too difficult to get one."	defect	closed	awaiting triage		ckan	wontfix			ckan	none
