2254	better hooks for templates	toby	toby	"TD look at issues and then email ckan-dev

meeting notes from 21-3-2012
general ideas non specific

Problem:
* We want to remove the Transformer usage due to performance and its close tie to genshi
* Want a standard way for core code and extensions to put code into the templates where *templates request it* (templates control insertion rather than extensions ...)
* Stacking versus overwriting on entry points
    * Relationship to h.requires('jquery', version) - http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_enqueue_script
Options:
* placeholders or helper methods
* {{user _info}} {{sub_menu}} is this equivalent to <span class=""insert-user-info""></span>
    * [xyz arguments] -> h.load_snippet('xyz', ...)
* ${h.snipit()}
