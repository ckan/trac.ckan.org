313	Allow packages to be specified by IDs in REST interface	dread	rgrp	"If a package name changes, a simple CKAN client may not be aware of this (not monitoring the push notifications, revisions or feed), so it is preferable to refer to the package by its (invariant) ID.

It is still useful to refer to a package by its name though, so both should be valid arguments in the REST interface.
