126,Change package state in the WUI (delete and undelete),dread,dread,"As a Package Admin I want to change the state of the package. In particular I wish to delete and undelete it.

(NB: this is quite separate from ""purging"" objects which is the term we shall use for irrevocable removal of an object from the domain model).

  * Only Package Admins (and sysadmins) should be able to change state

== Implementation Suggestions ==

  * 'delete' action should be renamed to 'change-state' (NB: this requires a db migration ...)
  * Have new package formalchemy form (created via inheritance?) to incorporate state attribute. Suggest this is rendered as a dropdown (and may be simple object rendering of state, i.e. do NOT need to change it to a single name such 'active').
  * This form should then be used when the user satisfies is_authorized(..., model.Action.CHANGE_STATE) instead of the usual fieldset
