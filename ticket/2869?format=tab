2869	user profile not linked on disqus until page refresh	shevski		"Reported by Daniel:

Problem: DISQUS comments don't appear with profile details (inc. username).
How to reproduce:
1) Go to a dataset, e.g. I went to http://s031.okserver.org:2375/dataset/ff
2) I logged into DISQUS using the Google Authentication, e.g. in my case that is okfn.daniel.lewis@gmail.com
3) I made a comment and submitted
4) It comes up with the comment, but no linked profile until the page gets refreshed"	defect	new	awaiting triage	demo phase 4	ckan				ckan	none
