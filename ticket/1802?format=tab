1802	Investigate CKAN deployment on Windows	dread	dread	"See how possible it is to run CKAN on a Windows server.

Plan:
 * Get CKAN code and dependencies installed on Windows
   * ideally as similar to standard package install as possible
   * virtualenv/pip should work
   * try Cygwin to help
   * SOLR and Postgres could potentially run on other servers if necessary.
 * Try to run on Apache
 * See if there are any issues"	enhancement	closed	critical	ckan-sprint-2012-03-05	ckan	fixed	[5d] [a:2.25d]	rgrp	ckan	none
