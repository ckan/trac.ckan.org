1439	Action API discoverablility	dread		"A good service API needs to be discoverable, so you are not always having to refer to the documentation html.

Maybe /api/action should return a list of actions available? (Currently this returns a 404.) 
 * It would be nice to sort these into get/create/update/delete.
 * #1438 Parameters for each of the actions must be discoverable too

/api/action/{action_name} should also return the help text / parameters allowable. (Currently this returns 400 error)"	enhancement	new	major	ckan-backlog	ckan			kindly	ckan	none
