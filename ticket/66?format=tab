66	Improve user account UI	rgrp	rgrp	"1. Link at top should say ""Your Account"" when you are logged in
  * when not logged in should say: ""Log in via openid""
  * Open Id info on /account/ should move to /account/login/ or be deleted
  * Going to /account/ when not logged in should redirect to /account/login/

2. When logged in the basic account index page should not give generic information but should reflect fact you are logged in by:

  * Saying something like: ""You are logged in as: ...""
  * Showing your apikey or a link to apikey
  * Giving you a logout link
