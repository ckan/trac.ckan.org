1395,"""Import Error: cannot import name UnicodeMultiDict"" when installing ckan from source",seanh,,"At the ''paster db init'' command when installing ckan from source I get the error ''""Import Error: cannot import name UnicodeMultiDict""'' (happens with both ckan 1.4.2 and today's latest bleeding edge code, on Ubuntu 10.04.3).

UnicodeMultiDict has been removed in a recent version of python-webob, and the ''pip install ... lucid_missing.txt'' causes a too-new version of python-webob to be installed into ckan's virtualenv (the new webob gets installed as a dependency of formalchemy).

I manually did ''pip uninstall webob'' and then ran ''paster db init'' again and it worked.",defect,closed,awaiting triage,,ckan,fixed,,dread,ckan,none
