408,Integrate CMS via proxying,pudo,pudo,"
* As sysadmin/user of CKAN I want to integrate a CMS to support easy addition of additional content ...
* I want to integrate with navigation 
* As a minimum I want to be able to add content pages (more stuff would be e.g. comments, sidebars, main menu ...)

Why: CMS are great at creating content and have very good editors and theme support ...

* deliverance: retheming on the fly 

http://knowledgeforge.net/shakespeare/hg/file/677eef9402e6/shakespeare/controllers/template.py

1. Rewrite urls for proxying
2. You need a theme to substitute into
3. pylons

Extreme version:
* 2 sources -> pylons/ckan app, cms
* 1 theme source: ckan or cms

1 frontend/proxy app which re-themes everything

Owned by CKAN:

* package/
* tag/
* group/
* api/
* /

Everything else proxied.
