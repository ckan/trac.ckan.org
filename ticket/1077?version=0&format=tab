1077	Switch to new vdm changeset model	rgrp	kindly	"Have developed a new ""changeset"" based model for revisioning in vdm. This has several advantages:

 * Much simpler
 * Cleaner separation of continuity from changesets
  * Supports certain operations that are impossible now (e.g. deleting all changes to a particular object irrespective of whether other objects were changed in same revisions).
 * Easier support for pending state and similar behaviour
 * Almost identical API

== Implementation ==

 * The main challenge with this change is schema and data migration"	enhancement	new	awaiting triage	ckan-v1.5	ckan				ckan	none
