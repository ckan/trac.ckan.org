1238,Viewing a package @date misses non-PackageRevisions,dread,kindly,"There's a problem with getting old versions of packages using @date. The query looks for the PackageRevision related to the date, but ignores TagRevisions etc.

So for example if you compare this table:
http://ckan.net/package/history/osm
with this view:
http://ckan.net/package/osm%402010-11-30%2000%3A21%3A49.627830
you actually see the 2010-01-13 11:13 revision - the wrong revision.
