918	Package preview doesn't show tags or groups	dread	memespring	"1. Edit any package
2. Hit 'preview'
Notice that the preview at the bottom doesn't show what tags or groups the package is in. 

This is because the new design of the package view only has this info in the sidebar, which is not displayed in the preview.

One might argue that this is ok because the tag is not a central part of the metadata, only used for searching, so it is ok not to preview it. But I wanted to check that this change was a conscious decision."	defect	closed	major		ckan	invalid		rgrp	ckan	none
