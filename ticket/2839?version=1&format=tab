2839	Specifying sort order breaks search results on group page	seanh		Create a group, create some datasets and add them to the group, then view the group's page with a sort-order specified in the URL, e.g. {{{/group/foo?q=&sort=title_string+asc}}}, no datasets are displayed even though there are datasets in the group that match the search query. Remove the sort order from the URL and the datasets will appear.	enhancement	new	awaiting triage	ckan-v1.8	ckan				ckan	none
