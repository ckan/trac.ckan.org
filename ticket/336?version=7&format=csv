336,Resource extension to REST API,donovanhide,dread,"== As a ==

CKAN client such as !ScraperWiki

== I want to ==

search for Package Resources, either by URL or other field, or just get them all. I want to be able to get all the resource's fields, such as URL.

== Proposed implementation ==

Add resource search API at:

/api/search/resource

AND resource added to model API at:

api/rest/resource

Functional differences from the !ScraperWiki suggested patch:

 * URL is not normalised
 
 * URLs are not grouped

 * All fields of the resource object are returned, not just the URL

 * Package is identified by its ID, not name or full URL. (This is for consistency in the API - you can simple prepend 'http://ckan.net/package/' to the package ID)

This is to make our API more general, simple and consistent. It means that the !ScraperWiki client has to do a bit more processing to get exactly what it needs. Is this ok?

=== Example search ===

POST 
{{{
{""url"": ""scraperwiki.com/"", ""all_fields"": 1}
}}}
to: /api/2/search/resource

returns JSON:
{{{
 [{""id"": ""a3dd8f64-9078-4f04-845c-e3f047125028"",
   ""package_id"": ""b8a325c8-af2a-43f3-8245-9db7d73dfbfe"",
   ""URL"": ""http://scraperwiki.com/lincolnshire-councillors"", 
   ""format"": ""CSV"", 
   ""Description"": ""Scrape of www.lincs.gov/councillors.pdf by ScraperWiki."",
   ""hash"": """", 
   ""position"": 2
 }]
}}}

Note use of package_id instead of package_name is something we're moving towards in the API, since names can change. When we've done ticket:341 then ckan.net/package/lincs-councillors will be a synonym of ckan.net/package/b8a325c8-af2a-43f3-8245-9db7d73dfbfe

=== Example model request ===

GET to: /api/2/rest/resource/a3dd8f64-9078-4f04-845c-e3f047125028

returns:
{{{
 [{""id"": ""a3dd8f64-9078-4f04-845c-e3f047125028"",
   ""package_id"": ""b8a325c8-af2a-43f3-8245-9db7d73dfbfe"",
   ""URL"": ""http://scraperwiki.com/lincolnshire-councillors"", 
   ""format"": ""CSV"", 
   ""Description"": ""Scrape of www.lincs.gov/councillors.pdf by ScraperWiki."",
   ""hash"": """", 
   ""position"": 2
 }]
}}}

=== Search Parameters ===
{{{
Key:  q
Description: Search all resource fields for the value

Key: url / description / format / 
Description: Search particular field for the value

Key: all_fields
Value: 0 or 1 (0 is default)
Description: If 1 (true), the full record of the package resource
(and it's package reference) are returned, rather than just the
PackageResource ID.
}}}

May also choose to introduce 'offset' and 'limit' to page through a large number of results.

JSONP achieved through API-wide parameter - see ticket:342

Search is case insensitive.

== Original request ==

Hi,
have attached a patch for adding a resource list api call. Have also added a JSONP compatible callback section, along the lines of #388.

Could also add a search version. Not sure what the best url would be for that though.

Haven't written a test as the structure seems to follow a functional spec. Is that document around somewhere?
