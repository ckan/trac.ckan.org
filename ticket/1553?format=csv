1553,Upload handles non-logged in user badly,dread,aron.carroll,"When you install ckanext-store (Storage extension) then CKAN displays 'Upload a file' button in the dataset/resource edit tab.

If you are not logged in, then this feature doesn't work, but there is nothing to indicate this. The button should be disabled.

Furthermore, it lets you think you are starting the upload process, the spinner spins, it says 'Uploading...' and stays like that for a long while.

This is a problem CKAN 1.4.3(ish) - 1.5.1 (current version) when you install the current ckanext-storage.",defect,closed,major,demo phase 5,ckan,fixed,demo-theme,,ckan,none
