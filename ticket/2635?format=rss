    <title>CKAN: Ticket #2635: Non-destructive SOLR reindex</title>
    <link>http://localhost/ticket/2635</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;
You can't run the search-index reindex on a live server because it will give us bad results for 2 to 3 hours while it runs. Can there be an option that doesn't delete the entire index at the start?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Instead it could just delete any items that don't exist any more, then delete them and regenerate them one by one. So the total number of datasets doesn't change much.
&lt;/p&gt;
