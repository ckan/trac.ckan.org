1. GENERAL NOTES
-----------------------------

We like the UK form a lot (http://ca.ckan.net/package/new?package_form=gov) but would like to rearrange the order of fields and would also like to drop a few unnecessary fields.

Here are the fields that can be dropped (or hidden, whichever is easier):

External reference
Geographic coverage
Temporal granularity
National statistic
Precision
Taxonomy URL
Author / Author email
Maintainer
